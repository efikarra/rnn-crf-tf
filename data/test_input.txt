not no no no okay cause if you haven t you need to get a tetanus booster and you re also old enough to get a pneumonia shot if you d like pneumonia vaccine cause we usually do that at age and you get one per life that protects you you know from pneumonia doesn t mean you won t get it but it will give you protection uh huh you make me sound like i already got it the way this cough going on
your lungs are clear are they ? uh huh
yeah they re totally clear so now are you interested in getting the the tetanus or the pneumonia vaccine ? oh long as it ain t gonna me i know the tetanus is okay but mm hmm it ain t too late for that pneumonia shot ? you get that any time of the year you thinking about the flu shot oh no i m not i had the flu shot yeah pneumonia anytime oh okay
now i don t think there s anything in your lungs i think it s upper respiratory your lungs sound clear don t have pneumonia at all alright now have you taken anything for your you said you took some cough syrup ? uh uh robitussin d dm ? oh okay that s the only thing you took ? beside nyquil okay it s a cough ? cause we gave you antibiotics now the last time you came no for some reason right so now is the cough getting better ? sometime it it it might be one or two cough and then sometime it may be three or four cough and some sometime it be like it just wanna come back but is it getting better ? better ? some like i said it it better but i don t want it to come back okay cause now do you have any history of allergies ? cause sometimes patients have allergies and that s what causes the cough it s not always an infection i i don t know because i never was told that it it ran through my family uh huh so i don t know all i know about the signs and i didn t know about that until about five years ago do you ever have any sour acid or bitter taste in your mouth ? i got one now okay cause the other thing is the cough could be what we call is reflux not even having anything to do with your lungs but sometimes the gastric juices will come up and will cause a cough so you could have reflux that s causing it now what s what makes you have a lot of a lot of gas um cause i i lately i been passing a lot of that okay why don t i try the uh you had it before prilosec yeah so i ll send that i think the cough may be some reflux and the gas may be related to that also now you should avoid eating spicy foods fried foods greasy foods shouldn t eat late at night and then when you do eat you shouldn t lay down within two hours of eating so cause i ve we gave you some medicine for reflux last year i think cause you had a cough and a sour taste but all the things that i just mentioned you have to do those in addition and you need to have the head of the bed elevated do you eat late at night ? i try to make my last meal no later than or seven o clock at the most okay do you eat like a lot of spicy foods ? fried foods ? no i m trying to eat healthy like
well okay i ll give you a script for the prilosec and see if that makes the cough better okay you can get dressed and then ah take you know where the lab is ? down the oh wait i gotta she gotta get those shots for you then she ll give you this so just you can get dressed
hi ! how are you ? i m fine how are you ? good to see you happy holidays same to you ready for your your physical ? yes ma am alright ! okay do you have any questions or any concerns regarding your health ?
um doing pretty good i just um you know i remember last time i was here was it last time i had the back pains ? mm hmm okay so that seemed to have uh i m not feeling that too much anymore well that s great but i didn t go to the therapist like oh well you managed without it that s you know it s most of the time back pain is muscular i mean right here you know it s right here mm hmm yeah and sometimes stretching tylenol and sitting the right way sleeping the right way those things help i don t sleep the right way okay well that can i sleep crazy that s probably why yeah that that can upset your muscles you know so be work on that and therapy will help um if it if you remember i went to therapy ? huh ? i never did go okay i know but therapy will help for that you know but since you don t have any problem you don t have to okay
but i really wanted to ask you um mm hmm um my lower stomach what s what s down here ? like right up right around here ? what s that ? sometimes i feel like a a jumping or something in there and i was jumping in your abdomen ? yeah like a baby s kicking or something maybe you have a baby uh uh don t say that what else could be kicking in there ? stop saying that i don t know you re the doctor i don t know don t say that you know what i tell people at work doc ? i say well you re the one that said it you know what i tell them now ? i say if i get pregnant somebody s going to have to go me or the baby that would run me crazy it s like a like a sensation of something moving ? it s like a it s like no pain ? inaudible like something kicking kicking hmm has to be a baby what else ? no pain right ? no not really no no change in your bowel movements ? they are the same ? no constipation or diarrhea or anything like that ? i ve just kind of become a little i m i m i m starting to you know let it out more often than you know okay so there is no change ? okay no bleeding ? no none of that and your weight s been good and not changed i mean there s no weight loss
hey i ve gained some weight do you know anything about a a a a band or something that you wear for that for weight loss ? what s it lap band or something ? oh lap band that s not that s that s a surgery it s not something you wear it is ? yeah yeah it s a surgery have you heard of surgery ? could you tell me something about it briefly ? it s a they cut your stomach or they band it tighten up and make it small mm hmm so it doesn t take too much food so you don t eat too much if you eat too much you get uncomfortable so there is you know it s and that s something that you can t reverse that once you get it ? um if it s a depending on what kind the band i think they can make it bigger or smaller you know um but the surgery where they cut part of the stomach off and attach it to the intestine oh no that doesn t sound good um yeah none of the surgeries sound good so how like overweight do you have to be ? but that is how they do that surgery it s a surgery it s not a band you wear okay ? uh i didn t know that they they they didn t when they said on tv they don t make it sound like that yeah to lose weight right ! so how much um overweight do you have to be before they will do that ? quite let s see you re and ? i m i don t know what that lady talking about well that s good keep that inch um i ve always been all my life don t my record say that ? i believe you let me put and let s see um you re yeah i think you have to be over bmi
i m sorry can you come listen to this lady breathe please ?
so so you re not not bad enough to you know unless you re really overweight or obese ow much overweight am i ? you are pretty much you should be ideally you know around oh okay so that gives you an idea so back down uh huh okay so pretty much diet exercise cutting back on what you eat and exercising be right back okay ? excuse me okay so um have any pills or anything that d that could that would take the appetite away ? um you know they have multitudes of side effects and you can t take it for a long time and uh so i don t understand it must be my metabolism because i really don t maybe it s i don t eat right because i don t eat that much anyway and still be gaining weight yeah well i think the metabolism slows down but but that is something that we cannot change but exercising and eating small frequent meals keeps the metabolism active okay ? well we i was just looking through your chart do you have any other concerns ? no none right now not right now okay um we um
oh you know what i have ? know what i have ? my allergies it seems like nothing is really helping me what are you taking ? i m taking a uh oh that s my phone the uh the generic the generic uh allegra ? are you using the nasal spray ? yeah can i how often do you use that ? how often do you use nasal spray ? i m trying to do it every day doc two squirts in each nostril each day ? is it two squirts in each nostril once daily ? it s not helping ? uh uh what symptoms are you having ? it s just like i don t take them you know i m going to start taking more than one you know one of the pills no what symptoms are you experiencing ? the sneezing um occasionally the nose still running you know and and occasionally i have the headaches you know uh huh well unless you have like a do you have like yellow stuff coming out ? uh uh a lot of yellowish stuff ? it s clear sneezing ? which is it seasonal or is it you know what ? you know what ? come to think of it i ve been having this last i think two months i have this cold that keeps recurring then i ll take the medicine i ll get better the next thing i know i m back sick again mm hmm did you get the phone ? re these symptoms seasonal or are they no normally you know i get a cold normally twice a year is this a cold then that s not getting better ? i don t know if it s a cold or you know because um a cold is you know usually starts with a sore throat feverish i don t have a sore throat that kind of it s almost like an ongoing congestion sneezing runny nose you know what ? i thought it was uh actually i thought it was sinus but then i realized it was cold so i took some theraflu and then i started feeling better and maybe about a week later i m back feeling the same way again and i went through the same process you know for about the last two months okay i m not sure what s going on it probably is allergies and maybe you have year round allergies do you have pets or anything at home anything changed ? uh uh you may want to see an allergist we we have you on rhinocort they work very they should work if you have allergies most of the time but if there we can change the medicine to flonase and see what happens make a difference make sure you clean up your nose what s flonase ? um blow your nose clear it before you use the flonase and it has to go and make sure your method is right if not you re not going it s not going into it s something similar to rhinocort it s a steroid spray okay ? it could be an allergy or you know nasal congestion we don t know it could be from allergies or not so try the flonase we can change the allegra to claritin and see if that will help okay ? but the claritin that s the one you get over the counter right ? yeah we and that didn t help me allegra helps ? it helps me helps more than the claritin did okay well then stick with allegra i tried the claritin everything else else that i that i ever took that worked um it was um uh right now but it was something d but i think my insurance didn t cover it or something can t think of the name of it now anyway
are you still on detrol ? i take that uh i need to take it more often though because sometimes i you have to take it only once a day it doesn t you can t take it more often i mean i i m talking about um i need to take it every day though okay yeah you have to take it every day you are taking it every day ? uh uh you have to take it every day for that for it to work for the bladder okay ?
anything change in your history or family history ? everything s the same from last year or ? pretty much
okay would you need any other refills this year this time ? um no no i just called in for the allegra refill so the nurse gave me that so um
did you get a flu shot this year so far ? uh huh okay now let me just go over some questions real quick with you um which we now have to cover for your physical um have you had a colonoscopy ? uh uh okay you re over the age of and we recommend that you have a colonoscopy do you know why you d have a colonoscopy ? what is that ? it is for you know how you colon ? mm hmm to rule out colon cancer to see if you have polyps in your colon it s a tube that s inserted through your rectum and and specialists do that that is to we mainly see if there is any precancerous lesions or cancer or nothing you know and that s uh again it s a screening test that means that is uh means you do it um when you don t have symptoms like you you re healthy you re fine you should do it now and it s prevention but are you woke for that though ? am i what ? are you woke for that ? this process you re talking about am i what ? are you awake ? oh ! am i no no they kind of sedate you oh okay okay they uh they sedate you somewhat it s not like you re completely under anesthesia i might could deal with that you should do that this year okay ? or early next year okay okay because it could take there is a wait for it but unless you start working on it you re not going to get in so try to work on it okay ? um your tetanus shot was in you ve had abnormal pap smears are you still having your periods or ?
uh uh once a year once you re you re still having periods once a year ? i had one earlier this year and last year i had one the whole year okay so you had one already this year ? when was it ? when was it ? it was like about february or something i can t remember yesterday i felt like cramps you know i felt like the you know the symptoms of a period but you know nothing came down so mm hmm
can we give a flu shot today ? hmm ? can i give you a flu shot today ? flu shot why do they give flu shots ? i m sorry i don t understand your question i mean why why why ? to prevent flu or influenza have you heard of flu ? you see i m looking at you have you heard of flu ? have i heard of it ? yes i have have you heard of influenza ? yes i have influenza is a severe infection it s like high fever degree mm hmm temperature and body pain and headache so this is to prevent that ? and yes and it it usually lasts for a week and you re in bed and you ll get that it s not like a common cold you re in bed for a week so it s to prevent that okay ? so we can give you that it s recommended for everybody over the age of last time i got a flu shot it made me feel sick is that is that how it s supposed to make you feel ? no can you read that ? that s why i put that there for people to read before you get the flu shot read about it make yourself comfortable it does not make you sick it may make you a little achy but should not give you flu your cholesterol and all that was a little elevated we need to repeat all that okay ? are you fasting today ?
i haven t ate today
okay there s blood pressure and diabetes in your family right ?
your sugars were a little borderline so mainly right now you have to work on your diet and exercise okay any question ? anything else ? hmm not really not really i don t think so
okay i m going to do your exam then okay we need a mammogram also do you do breast exams every month ? i try to you try to okay you ve not noticed anything abnormal have you ? uh uh sit straight um do you take your calcium ? no ? uh uh do you drink milk ? yeah i like when it s cold yeah i drink it how much milk do you drink ? well i drink it uh not every day but probably about three times a week three times a week well you should have at least two to three servings of dairy a day in order to catch up with your calcium intake so that s hard and that makes you gain weight you know what i mean ? so so it s easier to take a calcium supplement okay okay you said the milk the dairy stuff make you gain weight ? yeah of course it makes any food makes you gain weight right ? if you eat you know cheese and three glasses of milk it has fat and calories in it so unless you limit something else so it s it s you know math if you drink milk it has calories that s depending on the kind of milk you should not drink fat you should only drink fat free milk fat free cheese you know then uh the calorie is less but the pills are not having don t have calories so oh okay it s easier to take two calcium pills and maybe a glass of milk every day okay so what do you do buy those over the counter ? yeah citracal is really good citracal or oscal with has vitamin d in it okay ? and that s what you get from milk vitamin d ? yeah mm hmm
deep breaths in and out alright lungs are very clear huh ? nope i did i don t know that s part of life
alright let me do your breast exam oops how s your daughter ? oh you know what doc ? she s she s uh well she s gained some weight almost pounds how many ? she weighs weighed whenever we were here last and she was kind of upset about that how old is she now ? she s oh my god so we need to see a dietician you know that is a lot of weight so we got to learn how to eat three hundred pounds for a year old you know how tall is she ? she s i believe that s still too much mm hmm yeah her her doctor is she seeing a dietician ? okay who s her doctor ? dr s she has to see a dietician and and when she had the uh physical last huh ? obviously you i mean sometimes you have to limit buying things i have you know i have but you know what ? maybe there s something else going on everything that she eats she overeat like if she eat cereal she ll eat the whole box she ll eat the whole box ? pretty much and i ll be telling oh my god her d i ll i ll say d you re being greedy you can t be hungry you know ? yeah whole box of cereal in one one sitting ? oh my gosh and i try not to get the sugar cereal yeah yeah you know but she will still eat that ll make you gain weight oh my god we don t buy pop anymore you have just one right ? just i have an older daughter mm hmm i see and she s pretty normal ow god you hit me i didn t hit you i was checking your reflexes here put your feet on the stirrups now we re going to when you hit i m supposed to get a reaction when you hit me and everything ? yeah yeah yeah you didn t get a reaction though did you ? of course i did oh yeah here move your bottom all the way down put your feet on the stirrups okay so
so i got to make an appointment for the mammogram ? yes mammogram and the colonoscopy okay ? we ll get you the flu shot we ll catch up with all your blood work that s necessary okay ? and again you and your daughter both of you work on the diet again
it s the portion the type you know it s it s a lifelong change it doesn t happen overnight i know it s very hard on top of it the metabolism slows down think i ve gained three pounds since i yeah you have you have since i brought her to the doctor i brought her you have gained a few pounds since i last saw you since the last time ? come down all the way about four pounds oh that s too want to come down a little bit more ? to the yeah every pound it s easy to gain one pound to lose that pound it s very hard that s too many why is there so much why is it so just one cookie is enough to gain you one pound but it it you know what ? i like cookies you know what i mean ? but why um is that far enough ? okay now why do it s so much easier to gain than to lose ? why ? because of the metabolism is that what it is ? mm hmm mm hmm that don t seem fair you know nothing is fair now and every year your metabolism slows down so even if you exercise ? if you exercise it keeps keeps it burning but you have to exercise more than what you eat you know what i mean ? to burn things it takes it takes it takes about steps for you to lose one pound steps huh ? let me ask you something when you eat after late at night and you go to sleep why do you this this this doom ? i mean i always have those dreams where like i m dying and stuff you re dying ? i mean i oh falling and just can t stop falling every time i eat after a certain hour i don t know about that you know they tell you you shouldn t eat after what ? six or eight or something like that ? you should not eat after seven after seven ? i heard a lot of theories about it you know that your body doesn t have a chance to do something or you know i don t know about that i don t know why you should have a dream like that it s probably not related i have bad dreams and scary dreams every time i eat late
okay um everything looks fine normal inside no discharge okay and you test for infections too now ? no i just checked for pap smear pap smear is for cancer
i mean with the urine and stuff do you eah we do bladder infections and stuff like that are you having any burning ? or discomfort ? no no but i m always worried about that kind of stuff so no only if you have a burning would we test you for a bladder infection otherwise we routine we do a routine urine test okay ? because burning pain
okay so what are you doing ? what what what are you doing when you do when you do that ? i m checking for your ovaries i m checking your uterus size okay so is it normal ? ? yeah mm hmm
okay so you don t know what that jumping feeling could be ? i m not sure what that is inaudible maybe my muscles or something maybe it s gas that gas is something else too do you have a lot of pain or pressure in your lower abdomen ? maybe we can do an ultrasound no it s not painful but i ll tell you one thing that gas that gas can make you feel like you re having a heart attack you know ? mm hmm the only thing i can think of is to make sure the ovaries and the uterus are fine you know ? and then then um do an ultrasound pelvic ultrasound we do a colonoscopy to cover the colon we check on the ovaries okay ?
doctor you ain t trying to keep me here with you all day are you ? do i i have to go to the lab for the shots or no just wait here i ll have my nurse come take care of everything if you didn t eat we ll draw your blood today no i didn t eat i started to but i i didn t have much time if i had a little more time i would have okay we ll take care of all the paperwork you need to do the ultrasound the mammogram you don t have to do all these today you can schedule for them and we ll give you the flu shot blood work schedule for the colonoscopy okay ? mm hmm and keep working on the weight everything looks fine otherwise okay ? then you got to send the uh
and you should have your routine physical every year come in for a do a breast exam every month the calcium take two every day and one serving of one or two servings of dairy to prevent bone loss okay and prevent osteoporosis exercise regularly multivitamin one every day take a centrum or something like that let me push this out for you okay so you re going to um write that down for me ? you want me to write down the what the calcium to take ? is that what you want ? okay the calcium and you said a multi a multivitamin yeah mm hmm and that s it right ?
mm hmm and the i sent the allergy medicines to the pharmacy now you can see an allergist to to check on your symptoms
can i ask you something now ? mm hmm will you i occasionally get those little i get a little faint sometimes what is what could that be ? like dizzy you just feel light headed ? yeah it doesn t happen often but you know i can remember it happening at least twice this year and any chest pain or palpitations ? no shortness of breath ? just a faint feeling when you just a faint feeling well i guess it s uh after you eat a big meal ? no not that is it um after you get up from sitting or lying position ? if you don t drink enough liquids ? if you re dehydrated ? if you re getting too you may feel like that how do you know if you re dehydrated ? if you stand too long if you stand too long it may you may feel like that how do you know if you re dehydrated ? if you don t drink at least six glasses of water every day you don t get enough fluids okay so okay ? that s probably what you should do okay ? yeah because i know i don t get enough fluids alright try that and see what happens if you re not better let me know okay ?
okay so i can put my clothes back on ? yes you can i m going to have my nurse come in and take care of all the paper work you don t smoke no alcohol right ? huh ? you don t smoke ? no i don t smoke no alcohol ? ink uh bailey s from time to time i told you that just bailey s ? that s all i drink every day ? once in a while ? about twice a month or something okay well bailey s has a lot of calories if you look at the back i know it s the cream you know that s why i don t drink it but once or twice a month yeah be careful you know alcohol has calories too most of the time i be too tired or i ll be too tired to drink well don t drink then i don t i don t

uh huh okay well you re here for a routine physical but any particular issues or concerns ? you know he had a bleeding uh yeah i saw you were in and saw doctor j ? how s that going ? um well i it s not going uh completely the way i want it to but uh huh but uh um i just grin and bear with it you know uh huh so i can tell you so how long ago was it that you saw him ? it s been a it s been couple weeks now ? something like that because i had a bleeding node you know ? mm hmm and he cauterized the nose so mm hmm you been using the ointment ? uh the uh uh antibiotic ? uh huh yeah yes he said for a week you know it s been over a week now uh huh uh wednesday over a it s been a week wednesday you know it so are you still using the antibiotic ointment ? or no ? how often ? well i was taking it like three times a day now i m yesterday i took it once you know may maybe twice i member now for sure i think it was just once you know okay have you had anymore bleeding ? no uh the nose bleed twice you know for me uh huh uh the first time we went to the hospital mm hmm and the doctor stopped the bleeding mm hmm he said i should uh see my doctor mm hmm but uh but so um what happened was he well he had a an appointment in about two weeks mm hmm and he said we will wait two weeks well in the meantime it bled again you know bout a week later it bled again mm hmm so uh uh they called the doctor and uh he says come on in come right on in you know mm hmm and he took care of me right there okay okay so it sounds like you haven t had any bleeding since though no no not none since that no okay okay um how are your sinuses doing ? is it draining or congested much ? or no ? i i believe it is kinda congested at at times it is mm hmm uh especially when i m eating you know mm hmm for some reason when i m eating it always drains mm hmm okay so i don t know why you know but uh it does the only before i forget i wanted to show you something here uh see i i get these sores very so often uh huh and they stay on for a long time uh huh and i m just wondering if that s an issue that i should let you address you know somehow do they itch or hurt or ? they just kinda show up and just show up you know ? mm hmm just on the legs ? uh i think well on the left leg i notice mostly you know uh see now here it s starting a little bit here okay okay but uh i just thought i d mention that to in case that could be something serious
alright okay anything else that s been happening ?
um my uh i ve noticed too that uh um yeah i i have a hemorrhoid i think uh huh and i think it s causing some problems at times you know um um maybe maybe not i don t i don t know for sure actually maybe should to ask you about it well what do you notice ? well uh the feces you know that they keep coming out you know even though i don t go on the toilet mm hmm at times you know i i uh get some leakage ? some leakage yeah you know so i thought maybe i d mm hmm i d address that you know with you okay do you do you have any pain or itching around the rectum ? or more just the the leakage ? just the leakage i don t feel any any pain there mm hmm okay any problems with either constipation or diarrhea ? sometimes it i have some problems with with uh constipation mm hmm mm hmm but i m i m talking uh some of this colon cleanse mm hmm how often do you take that ? oh once a day okay so you re taking that pretty regularly ? pretty regularly yes mm hmm what what s in the colon cleanse do you know ? not really uh i couldn t tell you if if you want to i can i can get i can give uh you a call here and let you and read it read the read the uh what the ingredients are ? ingredients are yes mm hmm do you drink much milk or milk products ? just about none what about caffeine ? well i i i like my coffee you know every so often when we go to a restaurant mm hmm and uh he gets decaf mm hmm i usually get decaf coffee okay anything else in terms of pop or tea ? herbal tea i i herbal tea yeah herbal tea so no caffeine ? i m sorry no that s fine i understand um okay okay so really not too much caffeine it doesn t sound like ? no i don t i don t think so okay um i would i would wonder if it s your colon cleanser that s causing the problem from what you re telling me those are the things that tend to cause problems with with leakage um more so than anything else um and i would think your cleanser might be the problem um only thing is if i don t use the cleanser then then i get very very constipated mm hmm so so i stick with it you know because of of that mm hmm um the the things that are gonna be most helpful and not so much causing a problem in terms of the leakage as is more using stool softeners making sure you drink lots of fluids and and using a fiber supplement those are gonna be more the things that i think are gonna be important uh a stool softener is not a laxative so it s very safe to take um on a regular basis and won t give you problems like that um and i think taking a stool softener twice a day and and then maybe a fiber supplement like meta metamucil um would be helpful towards treating both the constipation but preventing the problems in terms of the leakage how bout now now what about food ? uh huh can i um uh what kinda foods can i eat uh with fiber with lots of fiber in it ? um well well oatmeal in general um you wanna you wanna eat lots of grains grains are the things that tend to have the most fiber and i can get you a handout with information on foods with fiber but in general it s the grains and then it s just important to eat healthy lots of fruits and vegetables um and and that s how you wanna try and and eat so doctor so he would take the stool softener twice a day plus the metamucil ? mm hmm once together well you know once a day h yeah once a day would be fine you know may be fine you you know and you can take more of the fiber than that but but i would start with that approach do once a day yeah so mm hmm no my my my preference would be for uh food you know eating foods that have quite a bit of fiber in it yeah and that s a good thing to do and even when you do that though you you you re really it s hard to get as much fiber as you really should have um and so it s not a bad idea to try and do both eat high fiber but also taking a fiber supplement it is important though to make sure you get enough fluids with that cause if you don t get enough fluids you still would end up with problems with the constipation so see yeah because i think i think that s why i got that the uh problem here because of that constipation that i mm hmm had in the past you know and mm hmm and uh uh that s when i i went to this colon cleanser cause i thought it was gonna be a good thing you know for me mm hmm and then i can remember when uh i was very very constipated that one time and i took that colon cleanse two or three times that day mm hmm and it cleared up mm hmm yeah and the ads make em seem real good but they do have some drawbacks too so yeah like anything else okay anything else that s been happening ?
doctor he s sleepy a lot is he ? yeah and i don t know if it s that medication that s he s taking for his leg that s hurting him his leg has been bothering him the gabapentin you mean ? i don t know doctor but something that s he s i m sleepy i m sleepy mm hmm okay i guess he s taking that three times a day i have a hard time that s a muscle muscle relaxant mm hmm kinda have a hard time falling asleep too you know i do you ? mm hmm very difficult time i i i i m lucky if i get like four or five hours of sleep you know is that because you re getting up to go to the bathroom or or cause the leg is bothering you ? or just having trouble sleeping ? just having trouble sleeping you know mm hmm okay and i because he stays up late mm hmm mm hmm
and i and i go to the bathroom also you know mm hmm i i wake up and i have to go to the bathroom so mm hmm and i that s part of it also mm hmm um then i have then uh once i get back to to my bed i have a hard time falling asleep again so mm hmm okay what i was
how s your breathing doing ? breathing ? um i would say that it s a it s about the same as it was before mm hmm um i i don t see that much of an improvement mm hmm any chest pain or chest tightness ? okay any heartburn ? okay um now you still taking the medications for the heartburn ? which medications are you talking about ? well you ve had two different ones at different times you had the the omeprazole or the prilosec uh oh you mean the uh metroprolol ? uh huh i m taking the metroprolol yes yeah no but that s the metroprolol is one but there s there s then the omeprazole it starts with an o oh oh ye i that s the one that i think uh oh what s his name ? doctor uh j ? mm hmm yeah i think that i i am taking that one too okay you taking that one twice a day ? okay and before that doctor h had given you the other one the the zantac or ranitidine yeah i m taking the i i am taking that okay alright and we ll be able to stop that one then um you don t need to take both of em that s that s more than is necessary oh which one which one should i should i drop ? we ll have you stop the ranitidine first and we ll we ll go from there so i ll i ll i ll write that down for you and i assume you re not taking the nasal spray anymore ? no because uh i had this i had this uh nosebleed so yeah they had you stop it ? so i so i stopped it yeah he s using the saline the saline uh yeah yeah mm hmm should i should i start back on it ? no i m just i m just checking i should stay with the saline ? yes that s a good thing to use uh is that something that i could use all the time you know ? the nasal saline ? absolutely very safe to use and actually very helpful for a lot of different problems um anything from allergies to dryness and even with infections it s a helpful thing to use so absolutely that s a good thing to take guess i should always have something should always have it on hand then mm hmm i would say so yeah how many times a day ? um three times three times a day ? mm hmm mm hmm if you don t get in three it s okay but shoot for three shoot for three okay doctor at the hospital they said for him to um lubricate his nose also with vaseline ? mm hmm i mean is is the saline enough or ? well the saline gets back further and the the the the vaseline is just kind of right out at the edge of the nose and right now you re using the antibiotic ointment it sounds like yeah how long why yes how long how long you could you could probably switch over to the vaseline now um you ve been using the antibiotic for long enough that really right now you re not getting any benefit from the extra antibiotic and it s probably just cheaper to use the vaseline and that would work just as well but use it anyway huh ? the vaseline ? yeah just a small amount you don t need a lot in there just a small amount and that s just to keep the moisture in and uh well why doesn t the uh um saline keep the moisture in there ? the saline is does not last as long as the vaseline but it gets back further up into the sinuses for you so you should use em so it s fine to use both in both nostrils ? yeah mm hmm mm hmm both are very safe to use yeah so um he needs uh hour s day to do all this
doctor are you related to uh father uh t ? no ? uh uh i m not he s pastor at uh saint uh uh rafael gabriel gabriel ? rafael ? uh huh yeah no mm mm meant to ask you
um okay now and you don t smoke ? no i don t smoke and i don t have no intentions of starting that s a good thing any alcohol ? not really no uh maybe might have a little bit of brandy or wine at times you know but that s sporadic pretty few and far between ? far and between yeah
okay how much activity or exercise are you doing ? well right now i wasn t doing anything too much because was uh busy with taxes so uh huh tax season you know ? mm hmm
no no he says his back hurts him and his leg mm hmm mm hmm and that s that s another thing too you re right but i uh am thinking of going back on it you know mm hmm uh exercise doing the uh the exercises that i was taught you know ? mm hmm over at uh henry ford here in the therapy ? the therapy yeah mm hmm so i ll have to start with that i think mm hmm
and then um you know after the income tax season is over after i finish everything i don t think you should wait til after the tax season is over i think it would be good to start before then what you wanna see me in the he s he s done with the taxes no i m not no i m not um but the thing about it is even if you just take five minutes you can take five minutes and and start with that and gradually work your way up to do doing more that would really be healthy for a lot of reasons it s good for your back you would sleep better it it s good for your breathing so it s really healthy for you to be trying to do some exercise and and um and it s important you wanna start slow but do it regularly and gradually build from there and i understand you might be busy doing other things like the taxes but you can find five or ten minutes to work in i think and and and not only that when you do the exercise it helps your energy level so you ll be even more effective and efficient at doing other things so um i agree with you there doctor because when i was exercising mm hmm i could i could feel that difference mm hmm so so the real key is doing it and doing it regularly and start slow but do it do something every day and and gradually build up and and you know so you wanna try and do the exercises that they showed you in physical therapy for your back um but also try to do something like walking walking would be a good thing to do and you you don t have to walk far but you have to do it regularly and and like i said i really think that would help you d sleep better your your energy level would be better and there s lots of other reasons that would be healthy for you right i i agree with you doctor i agree with you
okay um alright i guess that s about all of my questions was there anything else in particular from your perspective ? no i don t think so doctor the that s about it you know any other particular concerns or that you had ? no i think those were the main that
he stand for a couple of minutes and then he sits down he said his back hurts him his leg hurts him mm hmm i think maybe he should go back to um to the therapy ? to the therapy but i don t know if that s that might help him to to you know get back in yeah the groove to that routine with it so okay well let me wash my hands and let me take a look at you
okay uh okay doctor what about these sores yeah oh let me take a look at them here
okay i ll move out of here so you can we ll have to get k in there nice looking gal here to get j motivated open your legs actually would you mind stepping out into the lobby for oh sure and that way we ll all any soreness when i push up in there ? have you had your eyes checked ? uh i m due for it now okay say aah tilt your head back a little bit
doctor when uh uh when he cauterized my nose mm hmm what did he actually do ? what what is cauterization ? um it it s a way of um it it s not an actual we don t really burn the blood vessel but if you think of it like that you ve got the right idea where we kinda seal it off uh uh there s a small blood vessel that would come to the surface that s been doing the bleeding and you kinda seal seals it off or scabs it over and that kinda stops it from bleeding does that make sense to you ? no i m not a doctor so i i i cannot comment on that
mm hmm take some deep breaths okay that s fine breathe normally i m gonna tap on your back any pain as i tap ? alright go ahead and lay back just breathe normally that s fine
uh one other thing too i i uh just remembered mm hmm um you know this over here ? mm hmm when i when they were putting the uh uh pacemaker in ? uh huh and every so often i i feel a like a itch there is is is there any rash or just an itch ? well that s what i want you to take a look and see nothing that you ve noticed then ? take a look at it mm hmm see there it kinda hurts a little bit is there something there ? yeah yeah i ll get some gloves here and i ll just come i ll be come back to that i m gonna look at the legs here first these are the sores you re talking about ? yeah no that s not anything that would be a concern at all no ? okay uh uh yeah it is so long for it to heal
mm hmm there we just like set up here before i okay you don t need this tape on here you got a little bit of tape here oh i did ? mm hmm
maybe that s why i m i m feeling that uh mm hmm and that s fine yeah there s nothing there to worry about though oh really ? so i had all that all that tape ? mm hmm all that time since october ? oh no you did go back and see them i don t know when that was there so here i m gonna have you go ahead and stand up
am i just gonna have step down off the table i wanna take a look at the rectum there okay ?
to see if there s any signs of hemorrhoids or any other problem go ahead and step down off the table alright go ahead and turn around here just lean forward i m just gonna take a look here you re fine like you are there there s a little bit of a tag there but not actually a hemorrhoid right now that s fine fine ? uh huh okay well that relieves me
here let me pull this out for you go ahead and take a seat up there
okay so for the most part things look in good shape your lungs sound clear heart sounds fine blood pressure looks good um and uh so it it s gonna be important though you for you to get back and doing that exercising right right
and and maybe we ll go ahead and we ll get you a slip to go back to physical therapy get you back into that groove in terms of the exercise you should be doing for your back okay ? could could we wait until after april the th ? um i ll give you the slip and that s up to you okay ? um but you can call them to see the physical therapy okay ? to follow up on your back pain and they ll get you set up with those exercises but don t wait at least start walking okay ? okay i will
um really you you had a lot of blood work back uh uh done at the beginning of the year here and i don t see any need to repeat that right now so you re really all set for the blood work um in terms of some other routine things oh my cholesterol yeah we checked that when did we check that ? i think it was in november and it looked like that was in good shape it was really good actually yeah you had all your blood work in november so you really not need to have anything repeated now um and i know they did some blood work here when you were in the emergency room not so long ago as well and that looked fine so i m not i m not worried about needing to do any blood work right now well fine so um but a couple of other things you you you did see doctor h back in december and you re all set with that i think he wants to see you in june i think i have an appointment do you ? okay i think i do i m not sure about and i know you have an appointment to follow up with doctor j as far as the nose and um
and that s fine so um but as far as some other routine things it does i i don t know do you know when your last tetanus shot was ? tetanus shot ? mm hmm i don t i don t i don t have i don t have a ever remember having one okay so we probably should go ahead and take care of that for you now what s the tetanus shot for ? tetanus for lock jaw um and that s when you get cuts and things that you can get an infection that causes lock jaw and that s a life threatening infection and so if we can prevent that that s a good thing okay now is is it safe though ? the the the vaccine ? oh yeah that s something that we give normally okay well how come that i never had it before ? it s yeah you must have had it before but it s been quite awhile i think so a lot of teams people get them when they re in the emergency room with cuts and things oh i see so the other thing you re due for is to check your colon um you had that done i think it was five years ago where they go in with the scope ? and to check the colon so you re due for that mind you that s gonna be another thing they ll be able to tell if there s anything going on that we need to worry about as far as your your bowel um but um but you re due for that anyways as a routine test to check the colon and so i can get you some information on doing that okay ? well i might as well get some the paperwork set up that too you know i will get you the paperwork and then they ll call you they may end up wanting to see you before they do that test but their department they ll be in touch to to call you and and get that set up for you okay ? alright but in the mean time the fiber and the stool softener and stop using that colon cleanser okay ?
um and i think we re gonna get you refills on your prescriptions and we ll just make that one change in terms of stopping the one medication okay that okay that that um yeah i ll write it i ll write it down the ranitidine rani right okay ? i couldn t think of it offhand
okay so you can go ahead and get dressed and wait out front and we ll get that all together for ya okay the the okay doctor thank you very much

hi k how are you ? hi okay good afternoon did you bring the sun with you ? no ? no sun ? well how are you ? how are things ? things are alright ?
no ? what s the matter ? anything in particular ? hmm ? uh huh what s the matter ? aw talk to me i m sorry it s all i do all day long what s that ? cry ? really ? do you know why ? because my son s dead oh my god i can t stop crying i cry at work i cry at home i don t do anything anymore only reason i m here is because my daughter wanted me to come and i don t want her to have to worry i m fine yeah you look fine i know i ve gained pounds i hate myself and i m tired of telling people i m sorry for crying i don t think you should be sorry for crying you lost a child that s something that takes uh a long time to even begin to deal with when did you lose your son k ? in october whose is this now ? i don t know what happened to him ? can you tell me ? you think you can talk about it ? no ? how old was your son k ? twenty three he s was gonna be next month was it from a medical illness or an accident ? he s it was stupid my son s somebody because he was being a stupid kid he was smoking marijuana but somebody put something else in it then he died so they they intentionally put something else in the marijuana ? i don t know you have to talk to officers i just saw they didn t even tell me he was dead he was dead three days before i knew and could find him because they nobody told us they couldn t identify him ? they had his license his car and the people whose house he was at told em who he was but they just didn t bother telling us then when i questioned em they get mad at me so i know nothing and i never will so this was in detroit ? yes he went out at his friend s grandma s house he was spending the night there watching movies was anybody charged with anything ? i don t know the police don t talk to me what do you mean they won t talk to you ? when i call that man gets mad he says do you have an attorney ? why not ? i don t know i don t may maybe it would be a good idea maybe your if you hired an attorney they could talk to the police you know obviously you re you re hysterical about this because of the loss you suffered so it s probably very difficult for them to talk to you no i be good when i talk to em well it s not about being good or bad i mean it s about you know it s just you suffered a terrible i don t be hysterical to them oh that s that s just horrible such a waste have you had um what are you using right now for support ? mainly your daughter ? my friends your friends and family okay how many other kids do you have k ? are you a religious person ? not anymore no ? because there ain t nobody there ain t no god they take away him they shoulda taken me if there was justice because he has more to live for and i don t so it s there is no god have you worked with anybody in behavioral services um during this time k ? was there somebody there that you were seeing before ?
okay so the the zoloft that you ve been taking was something that came from myself or k or ? that s for stupid menopause which doesn t help right now ? i m sorry ? i didn t i m saying that that was because of things from menopause right ? well that s what i m trying to find the reason why uh why we had you on that because i was starting to have panic attacks oh yeah that s right that was started for a panic disorder mm hmm when my periods had stopped and i think that was back in um july of uh huh
do you um have you been able to eat okay ? mm hmm or are you eating too much ? yeah ? you re overeating now ? yeah i ve gained pounds and i can t wear my clothes i hate myself i don t leave the house but i can t stop eating yeah i think you re gonna need some professional help from your emotional standpoint this is so hard so hard to suffer that kind of a loss um you know it s it s affecting you in a lot of ways and i know you don t believe it now and i don t blame you um there will come a time when you you you will think about it in a tragic fashion much as you do now but it won t touch you in the same physically uncontrollable way um but you have a lot to work through before you can ever get to that point uh that s where i think we need to place our efforts with you and a lot of the things that you do now are manifestations of the way that you feel so when you eat a lot um you know that s a manifestation of being depressed if have you been able to sleep at all ? all this time i m yawning all day long are you sleeping all day long ? no i go and work go to work do you sleep during the night ? but i and like two hours later every day because i can t get ready mm hmm do you sleep at night ? kinda yeah how how how many hours do you think you get uh of sleep at night ? i don t know five or six i m sure
are you having bowel difficulties right now ? no ? those are moving pretty normally okay ? how about urination is that giving you any trouble ? mm mm are you having any chest pain ? no ? palpitations ? do you feel your heart beating funny ? mm mm
um do you feel episodes of panic now ? do you ? not i don t know if it s as much panic or i don t know i did for awhile that s why i called and i asked if i could take more but something happened with that whole thing i don t know something i just forgot about because then you say yeah that you d call it in and then i go to the pharmacy and there was nothing and then the prescription that came wasn t for anything more than the other one and i don t know what happened so i just said forget it i just didn t want to fool with it so you just stayed with the the amount you were taking ? mm hmm
would you be willing to see somebody in our behavioral services department ? i don t know what that is well behavioral services is like psychotherapy that kind of thing if we re gonna use medication to help you with you know that before i came to you i hadn t seen the doctor in years remember mm hmm so you expect me to go to someone like that when i don t even want to come to you well um you know i think what we wanna do is make sure that we have you on the right medication to help you with all the things you re experiencing number one number two i think we wanna give you a chance to um develop a relationship with somebody that s not a relative or a friend somebody that you could say anything to and not care about retribution in any way don t care how they react and because in doing so it it s kinda of a catharsis it s like getting things off your shoulders all the frustration you must be experiencing all the anger you must have built up inside of you i do have one person that i can tell anything to well it s good i m glad for you i still think you probably are gonna need professional help can you excuse me for one second ? oh okay thank you well i think what we ll do is i won t hold you to that i will ask you to see a psychiatrist so that we can get the proper medication cause that s all they re gonna deal with and uh then we ll get their impression of whether they think you would benefit most from that therapy or not okay ? you know i haven t lost a child like you have i did lose my very best friend um dating back to childhood um about five years ago now and uh and i think i felt if not the same as you feel now very close to the same and it took a long time and uh i ve still whenever i talk about it and i feel myself you know sorta welling up um it you never get over that never changes um the difference is that it s again it s not a uh it s not that that the same feeling of emptiness you know that you have in here like that empty pit um that hollowness that you have that that actually does get better believe it or not okay ? i know it s uncontrollable i know i know i know i m so sorry i won t put you through a lot today k cause i know that you got this is obviously no i m you everything wrong with me today because just in case i don t come back do you feel suicidal at all ? no ? ever think about taking your own life ? i can t do that because then that would hurt my kids and i d never hurt my kids
open for me please aah look right here stop breathing please and breathe and stop and breathe i m gonna put the back down for a second for you okay ?
can i ask you a question ? you know with the cholesterol medicine ? mm hmm i remember when i gave you a hard time because i didn t want to take it because they ve got side effects mm hmm and then you say i take it for awhile and then you d do a blood test and you d see what they re like mm hmm and then if it gets normal then the medicine would go away no no no no no no let me explain that that medicine works by inhibiting and enzyme an enzyme is a protein that catalyzes a reaction so in other words it allows the it it allows this product to become cholesterol okay ? the medicine inhibits that enzyme so it prevents the production of cholesterol but once you remove that medication then the enzyme is free to do whatever it was doing before we have people that that take cholesterol lowering medications that get away from them because they have other reasons okay they eat poorly for example well if they fix their diet and they start exercising then they might not have to take the cholesterol medication but if you re one of those people who hasn t had a dietary problem or an exercise problem in other words you re one of the that just doesn t have enough receptors in their liver to pull the bad cholesterol out of the blood stream then you you know it s unfortunately you re gonna be taking cholesterol medication the rest of your life if you wish to you know receive the benefit from it mm hmm
nice deep breaths in and out through your mouth okay let s have you lie back please you don t have any lymph node enlargement in your neck okay ? there was no noises over your carotid arteries to suggest any blockage your thyroid gland is normal your lungs are clear you don t have any candles in your ears
i just have fat well that s fixable not unless you know a plastic surgeon who wants a girlfriend to be a guinea pig oh you admit yourself that you re not doing the things that you i know you could do to maintain better conditioning even when i have it off it s still because of losing so much weight it s not good
can you take a deep breath in for me please ? and out in and out

are you consuming any alcohol now ? are you ? how much um which alcohol are you consuming now ? i don t know it varies depending on the day not too much how much do you average in a week do you think ? hmm ? not a whole lot what does that mean ? it means can you quantify that for me ? how many drinks do you average in a week ? an average week ? maybe three
okay did she measure you today out front ? yeah i don t know what s up with that yeah that s a lot shorter than what you thought eh ? yeah i don t know where that went that s insane i can t i still don t believe and a half mm mm no ? mm mm think she made that up ? mm hmm i didn t go from to and a half in a year i don t think so well i don t know if you were last year i you you told us you were not measured that last time hey i measured at the gym and i m taller than and a half i m at the gym are you ? mm hmm i don t know okay young lady
now i have questions for you go right ahead alright here s one like i say i m gonna take care of business today this is been bothering me for since twenty years huh ? mm hmm isn t that insane ? what is it that s been bothering you ? this finger sorry but it just won t go down is that is that what it is ? that s right and everyone keeps saying k stop that what s the what s the matter with the finger ? no alright see my finger see it s different than my other ones i had come into the doctor for it you know ? and they had given me some cream or medicine to put on it well i see it s dry and flaky on the end is that what you re talking about ? but it gets like these little bumps on it mm hmm and then my skin falls off and it gets really painful mm hmm and it just it s growing you know and it s only that one finger is that the finger that you i mean is there you do most often with that finger ? is it rubbing against paper most often ? i m not even right handed not even right handed ? i m left handed okay i mean it looks like an dermatitis which is dryness to the skin yeah that s what they gave me some stuff a nd a lot of times uh you know if if a particular i mean you could look at my hands for example there s dry areas here mm hmm you say why are those dry areas there ? you know well it s because for some reason when i m working with paper i m up against that area and the paper particularly in the winter uh absorbs all the moisture out of the skin and that leaves you that with that area of dryness there but even my fingernail s like a different color here it s always been a different color and uh my nail breaks off more even though i m with my job my the hands are cruddy anyway yeah as far as the nail i mean it looks like there s more maybe more you don t have any polish ? just clear polish over here ? i do on all of em but this one s always redder than the other ones yeah it s a little more there s a little more capillary uh prominence which is the super the really tiniest blood vessels close to the surface but the nail bed doesn t appear to be thickened at all and like i say it s always peeling and i it hurts but i don t i don t know just that one finger and i get them little bumps and then it starts peeling off did you did you work with a dermatologist for that before ? at first and then it went away but then it started coming back and you said they just had you putting moisturizer over it ? so did you try that again ? well i use hand cream but not the type of stuff that they had given me they give me some prescription thing i don t know i just thought was that with it s nothing name ? it s just yeah in new baltimore i can t even remember the person s name but she wasn t there very long so whatever that is it can just do one finger ? yeah just like there s one spot here hmm interesting yeah cause then it s always like hard and it looks gross i see a note from the dermatologist but i don t actually see any mention of uh anything going on with your hands it wasn t the dermatologist that who had it was at the doctor s office in new baltimore oh yeah no the dermatologist when i had all that poison ivy or whatever it was yeah i don t have that information unfortunately so you don t even know what it was that you used ? no it s been so many years that s okay if it s nothing then that s good i was just wondering well i think the first i would do is probably use some eucerin cream to that area twice a day and uh when i use it the second time at night what i would do is take a little piece of of uh handi wrap mm hmm or saran wrap and wrap it around there to occlude it so the moisture stays in better do that for a couple of weeks and see what kind of a difference it made for you i mean moisturize moisturizing the area may simply take care of the problem
okay oh my god don t yawn you ll make me fall asleep i yawn all day long i can t help it you re making me snooze i gotta stop being so tired i i have another problem
okay i got a few minutes to deal with that and then i m gonna have to move on k because i spent a long time with you here today and i got other people waiting for me so what what would that be ? i ll save it no it s okay tell me now no no is it a prolonged problem ? i don t know well why don t you mention it and i can give you an idea ? well because like when i go to bed at night my leg hurts a lot or if i m sitting on a airplane and i fly a lot because my kids don t live in michigan i have to get a aisle seat because my i can t keep my leg straight i it just starts hurting really bad up and down the back okay is it is that just old age ? go up the back of your calf ? or the back of your thigh ? mm hmm like it s like right through here hmm and you notice that when you re on the plane ? i notice that like when i m sitting on the plane like my legs get you know and i have to move em sometimes if i m sitting in the car or sitting at work but i can stand and you know or at night when i m sleeping you know it gets bad and like if i lie on my side and then i ll be on my back for awhile and then it gets okay and then i ll go to sleep and then it starts hurting how what does the pain feel like to you ? it s i don t know kinda like it just like it cramps like my leg i i have to move it it s like you know what i mean ? it s like a feeling like you have to move your leg it like it has to move i don t know how to describe it other than that does it feel restless ? or is it a mm hmm is it a sharp pain ? or is it it s not like really hurtful but it s like it s a really uncomfortable whereas i have to like i say if i m at work i have to stand up and and go walk or you know on a airplane i always gets an end seat because if i m sitting then i start getting it then i have to like you know move my leg yeah and when you get up and move does it feel better then ? mm hmm but if i like i say it s it wakes me up at night because it gets so uncomfortable my leg and then do you does it feel like there s actually a tightness in it or like a drawing sensation at all ? no i know what you mean and i had a weird thing like on the same side i don t know it s like it went in like this i i couldn t move it i grabbed the my other hand i couldn t pull it it was pulling in so tight it lasted a half hour and i was ready i you know i called my daughter on the phone being like i don t know what to do i m mean it s on my thumb i felt retarded but i it s that s happened to me twice within and i can t move my thumb out mm hmm it s sad i mean yeah there are some disorders with electrolytes that can cause that to happen sometimes disturbances in calcium levels in the bloodstream really ? mm hmm i mean it was just the freakiest thing i just it s well i think you know that s something we ll want to pay attention to when we do your blood work today i don t see that you ve had a disorder uh like that previously but that goes back almost two years so something may have changed in the interim well we re gonna do uh a few routine blood tests on you today k
um and then i m gonna get you uh a phone number to behavioral services i do i would ask that you be seen there at least for uh an evaluation um i think you re up to date with the other items here mm hmm do those people have offices like at the new baltimore building ? they have em right here on uh on garfield and canal ? oh they re not in ? no they re uh right you know about five minutes from here yeah on garfield and canal it s called clinton oaks and uh they re henry ford people and yeah but why do they have that oak name to it ? why do they have the oak name to it ? yeah like oaks and all them oak places are i never thought about it that way i don t know i work at a school with kids who talk i never thought about it that way
can i ask you one thing and don t say anything until you listen to the whole thing listen i know and i know how you believe in this okay ? but i m just asking you is there any way that you can give me prescription just for one month one month for something so that i can get together and start losing weight again ? just one month there there is no prescription to make you lose weight k to help you gain control i know there is
well i that s why we re having you see the psychiatrist what we need to gain control of right now is your mental status i know because i can t stand like this okay so that s why i am having you see them cause you already take an anti depressant slash anti anxiety drug and i would feel very uncomfortable with getting you something else that might goof up the picture because these things actually take two to four weeks before you reach a steady state with the medication so i definitely want their opinion about what the best agent for you is as far as you know uh your weight gain being associated with your depression status yeah i think it probably is so you need to fix the actual underlying problem in order to have the second one taken away but there isn t any medication anyway that makes you lose weight
they ve all been taken off the market because of cardiac problems okay i m so sorry alright you get dressed i ll send back in for you okay ?
i'm dr r and you have met e here right ? thank you so e i see that you are in the henry ford um

of air alright sure um now and uh what's with your uh with your back pain ? how long have you been having this for ? um for over a year it just some days it's more severe um i mean i took the tylenol um excedrin i take you know anything motrin and stuff like that mm hmm and i never get no relief and even sometimes at night i just oh i just wish i could just crack it you know mm hmm right now where exactly is the back pain ? in this upper part right in here oh in the upper part and you're pointing more towards your right side is that it ? okay are you right handed ? i am you are and you know if you kind of see that it's under your blade shoulder mm hmm blade is that is that where it is ? alright now is it like a constant pain or off and on kind of pain ? t's a constant pain constant pain on a scale of one to ten how much would you say it would be ? a seven okay alright i've had some ten days but uh huh seven what do you think makes it worse ? i i guess i'd say my positioning uh huh you know sitting at the desk and so forth you know how you kind of get sloped over mm hmm and i know i do have like i said the osteoporosis that's where the fractures was because i've had fractures in there m hmm and that's my diagnosis i think that but you know i just i can just be laying in bed and it just you know it just aches st aches alright now what what makes it feel better ? like what do you do ? stretching back stretching mm hmm yeah it relieves some of the pressure off of it mm hmm sure now when you take a deep breath does it hurt you ? no ? alright now does it go anywhere else ? does it just stay there or does it go up ust stays there okay and no tingling no okay and you don't have any weakness in your hands or anything like that ? i do i got a trigger finger right now oh but that's on your left hand though left hand but nothing on your right uh both of my hands i have um i don't know i got the braces for my hands carpal tunnel ?
okay carpal tunnel sure so now i do see that you do take pills for your high blood pressure i do and that is atenolol milligrams once a day mm hmm and then you also use pills for your cholesterol yes zocor

alright ? okay now um any other pills which you take ? i no i take uh claritin you know the sinuses but i don't take it on a daily basis uh huh um because i have and when it flares up you know with a cold or something i'll take it then for maybe a week or two uh huh mm hmm alright and then i do see that you are on spiriva too mm hmm right who put you on spiriva ? um i had a bronchitis um attack and mm hmm through the emergency and then i had to come into the clinic like a couple weeks after uh huh for a follow up and i think i don't recall which physician right and did they tell you that you had emphysema you had copd or no ? no is spiriva helping you with your breathing ? when i have i don't do it constantly it's only when you know i have the oh the spiriva right you know actually spiriva is not a rescue inhaler it's like it's not like albuterol albuterol is the one that you take when y ou're short of breath right i just take crush the pill and you know that is um spiriva is supposed to be for long term and it has to be taken it has to be used daily i didn't know that alright ? so it is not for uh it's not like albuterol when you use it only as needed that's a rescue inhaler when i get sick and use it for a week it does help it does help yeah it does um it seemed like it i don't know if it's like a steroid when you know uh huh stop the inflaming of the bronchial tubes mm hmm right you know spiriva does help because it uh it's kind of it's going to help you with your bronchitis with your emphysema it's going to uh keep your airways open so see they never diagnosed me i don't recall them saying that i had oh emphysem emphysema or copd
sure any other pills that you take ? no ? alright alright any surgeries on you ? uh i had a hysterectomy uh huh uh i had some fatty tumors removed off my back uh huh and i had some bone surgery on my one of my feet uh huh that's that's it that's it and the hysterectomy was it complete ? did they remove the ovaries too or ? they didn't remove the ovaries but it was some years ago they did they didn't they didn't okay so the ovaries are still there and why was the hysterectomy done ? um just kept having you know they said all the i had four children and it was pretty close together and it just kind of tore the walls down and right was it like did they tell you that your pap smears were abnormal or ? no no nothing like that just uh continuously having monthly periods two and three times a month oh okay so for heavy periods heavy periods and did they tell you that it was like fibroids or anything like that ? no mm hmm and this was like years ago ? about really
twenty four and you never had any abnormal cells on your pap smear ? no okay sure um now and then now in your family your mother or father we're talking about first do they have any medical problems ? my mother had lou gehrigs disease she's decreased uh huh my father has uh heart and high blood pressure and diabetes right high blood pressure diabetes and you said heart problems ? mm hmm uh at what age did he have the heart problem and what kind was it ? um in his s and just um i think i don't know what you it wasn't congestive heart failure was it a heart attack or was it a he did have a mild heart attack mild heart attack ? was it like irregular heart rate ? it started out as that and then it turned into a mild heart attack mild heart attack alright now how about your siblings ? your brothers and sisters do they have any medical problems ? no ? alright any cancer in the family ? no ? any other heart disease in the family ? no ? alright sure so are you single you married ? married and how many kids ? four kids sure now um because you're smoking how about alcohol ? do you drink alcohol ? no alcohol alright and how many times were you pregnant ?

okay sure alright so let's see where exactly does it bother you ? right right in there okay right in this area ? yes right in there right mm hmm right now what we will do is basically now lift your right arm up up does it hurt you anywhere ? no front ? back ? yeah it's it's typically related to positions this particular thing it's a muscle pain related to positions mm hmm i would say use uh the right chair because you are a csr you will be working on the computer all the time right ? it's you have to use the computer right right right you know the elbow mm hmm the height of the elbow as well as the desk should be at the same level you know you you will have an ergonomics department in the hospital mm hmm have them come and evaluate your chair and your desk height alright especially the keyboard height and they will be able to do some some repositioning for you and that will that's going to help you there and the other thing is basically if you have this pain until until the repositioning is done because it takes mm hmm you can apply um the over the counter heat wraps mm hmm like the icy hot or right yeah the heat wrap or whatever you know that's going to give you a great relief you know until the repositioning is done you will have this pain off and on alright ? otherwise i don't think there is anything wrong wrong with your chest wall mm hmm or even for that matter your shoulder blade either okay ? and this is one of the most common complaints i hear about especially for people who are using the computer all the time
right now the other thing is basically your chest pain right ? mm hmm now where exactly can you please ? right there okay in that spot itself ? right alright okay let me just hurts you as i do that ? no ? the um pain from your heart is on the left side of your chest because that's where your heart is mm hmm your pain is typically located on the right side right yeah and it's only in one particular spot okay i don't think it's from the heart okay ? uh but what i would do is basically do an ekg right now okay ? and we will also do a chest x ray to make sure there's nothing going on in there and if everything checks out fine if the ekg and chest x ray check out fine i will not be concerned and uh moreover your stress test was the exercise stress test that is basically you run you jog on the treadmill right ? right yes yes yeah so you did pretty well on that and then that checked out fine too so first we'll do an ekg first and then we'll take it from there i don't think it's the heart it's rather just the chest wall pain the muscles uh muscles of the chest wall
okay ? alright now let's examine your spine right in there is where this is the place where it hurts you most ? right in there in this ? and this again is i had like you know the fatty tumors removed there right i see the scar there so this is this is the place exactly where it hurts you ? mm hmm yes spot ? alright alright so what we'll do for you is basically make you lie down okay alright and then alright now straighten your legs out for me please mm hmm now leave your leg on my hand and then let me just lift it up fantastic does it hurt you anywhere as i do that ? no but if i turn oh okay if i turn it will so let's uh let me do some more things and then we'll let you turn okay ? now can you please bend your knee for me ? alright pull it all the way in okay tell me where it hurts okay ? right in there right in there is uh huh where it hurts ? here here ? uh huh alright sure sure we'll we'll get you off we'll get you off okay ? now the same thing pull your pull your leg in pull your leg in and out does it hurt you ? it hurts you too sure now the same thing with the other leg no problem with this leg no problems at all ? nope uh uh good now lift this leg against my hand against my hand please now this one too okay now um you said it's been going on for over a year now ? alright why don't we get x rays of your hip ? alright ? i'll also send you to physical therapy there could be a component of arthritis either it could be your hip or it could be your back alright ? so we'll get x rays of both your back as well as your hip we'll send you to uh uh physical therapy and we will see how you respond i want you to lie down for me please you are okay or not okay ? okay so i'm just going to and then um we'll see how you do on that alright and the other thing is basically do you want any kind of pain pills to help you with the pain ? if you could give me some yeah just to some nights it's so bad some nights it's so bad i i mean i just okay have you tried something for it ? i've tried tylenol i've tried over the counter uh i've had tylenol 's and um what is it ? uh dr r gave me uh darvocet okay mm hmm and they didn't even help they didn't even help okay sure i'll um let let me check and i'll and i'll tell you what

okay take your time okay alright let me just this off okay can i pull the curtain over ? alright okay so so we talked about your back pain mm hmm uh we talked about your right hip pains for the hip you're going to get x rays of your spine okay ? as well as the right hip okay ? i'll also send you to physical therapy and we will see okay part of the problem you you do have osteoporosis so but then we'll with x rays of the spine we'll be able to see if there is anything else going on there okay ? and of course physical therapy is going to help you okay now uh you're not allergic to any medicines right ? so i could give you extra strength motrin motrin have you taken it any time ? yeah i took motrin for it doesn't help at all ? when this when this i don't know if it's a nerve it just when it just it hits it just oh it just i mean you can cry with it it hurts so bad you can cry right is it like a sharp shooting pain which lasts for a few seconds and it goes away ? is that what no it it it's like you get like a toothache when you hit that nerve and then when you mm hmm you hit it it's like it just stays and stays and stays and it just has i mean a good minutes to an hour mm hmm and then you know then it'll slack off and stuff but you have to like once you've irritated it leave it alone for a little bit mm hmm you know what ? okay let me see so tylenol number three did it help you ? no ? that's what i said i took i you know my husband had some and i took them and i said oh you know i took over the counter uh different things and i said something's got to relieve you know right you know why don't we first do x rays of your of your spine as well as your hip ? i'll also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxer okay ? it's called flexeril okay take one pill at bedtime only as needed it's going to make you drowsy okay ? it's really going to make you spaced out so make sure that you should not only at nighttime ? yeah you should not do use it during the day don't drive that's when it's more severe you know you know don't drive at all okay ? and then you said the pain is only at night nothing it's well you know if i'm like i could be walking you know at work and then just all of a sudden and it hits you know then it hits you then i have to so i sit down for a minute but it's more once i lay down turn i've irritated it mm hmm in turning right um and then uh and it shoots all the way down your leg you said ? it just my whole from my whole my butt butt all the way down alright it could be a muscle spasm but then we'll we'll try the flexeril and uh try the heat okay ? and then um for pain actually i could give you vicodin but it is rather strong you think you would be able to handle vicodin ? have you tried vicodin before ? it's kind of like a i tried it uh you can give me that and i can first though right ? mm hmm flexeril is not a pain pill it is going to relieve the spasm is there is in your muscle it's going to relieve the pull in your muscle and that way it might help you partially with the pain but it's not like okay i'll then give me the vicodin for the pain and then i okay you know why don't we try one thing ? along with flexeril why don't we try motrin ? because motrin has anti inflammatory component in it so if it is related to inflammation this motrin should do the trick okay ? and always take motrin with food only okay so it'll be motrin and then flexeril okay and then what i will do is basically i'll see you back in one month okay ? and to kind of re evaluate and see like if it really helped or not alright ? if it's not showing any improvement then we will
we'll go further yeah we'll go further from there alright ? and then with regards to your chest pain we'll do an ekg we'll do a chest x ray okay let me take a look at the ekg and based on what i see we'll take it from there alright any other questions for me ? no ? alright so actually don't get dressed my assistant will come and she will do an ekg for you right now she'll also get the paperwork okay after i take a look a look at the ekg i'll come back and then we'll uh kind of it out okay ? thank you

now you know i told you i might be kind of dry okay ? yeah yeah it ll be just a what would make one bleed ? what do you mean ? ah after menopause ? oh the dryness is it like a period or is no no no pressure okay pressure that s it oh you telling me pressure yeah i was just you re not asking me ? i m just telling you oh no i m talking about after but see is it because i don t it that much ? no it s because you re dry oh really ? mm hmm it s not like a period right ? sorry no no no now relax your muscles alright i m coming out in a second okay and it s very breathe in and out good just going to give you a little i m coming out okay ? don t move yet don t move yet i m going to give you i m going to give you no i don t do it too much okay ? no i don t do it too much okay ? i m going to give you a pad but even my speculum was bleeding because it s so the lining of the vagina and the cervix are very very thin as we get to menopause it s very common so using some ky cream will help quite a lot okay ? to moisturize just a little cream on the outside i bought me some i got something new well it might not be new but some cream or some gel that s in tubes and it says it lasts three to five days okay good so have you tried it ? because if i don t sit up when i don t do nothing just it s just i m irritated yes yes down there you know what i m saying ? i would use it on it every day right so make sure that it s lasting and you re using it cause it s very because the woman is going to be feeling like that irritated just don t i feel irritated sometimes yes yes yes you would now you re everything looks good except for that that s very delicate well i ain t did nothing in probably about a month the lining is very thin and it bleeds easily okay ? so here s a pad you re going to have some spotting so i m not surprised what you told me goes with what i m saying mm hmm i m going to do a breast exam will i ever want to have sex ? is your desire diminished ? okay just lay on your back and let me do a breast exam while we re talking ah that s very common too after menopause that s why i don t do it that s why i don t want to do it and my boyfriend he s like he thinks i m seeing somebody else no that s very common after um and that s very common for men to think that the woman is seeing somebody else ? that s common to i don t about that but it s common for the desire to kind of wean because of the lack of hormones well give me some more hormones well how about if we make you sleep first ? and see if that fixes it cause just that being tired okay ? you don t think you re depressed now do you ? no no i m feeling good it s just that i want to do it i just don t want to hot flashes ? ah but not bad a little you don t have time for hot flashes huh ? just a little it s a just i don t want to do it and he don t understand and it s just well let s try this and i want to see you back in three weeks do you want to do that ? uh huh don t forget the pad what do women do ? you can do two things we re going to make sure you re not depressed make sure you know you re not sleep deprived like you are and third is using hormones but it s the testosterone the male hormone that s that helps with libido okay ? so that s a cream that you can put on on your chest for example there s some treatment in other words available for it you know cause see i guess what s against me is don t want to do it and then when i do do it it don t feel all that good so you know ? yeah yeah but just the dryness can be a big part of it too tell me about it yeah alright good so let me see you back in three weeks and see how we re doing will you write me out a prescription for a sleeping pill uh huh fosamax right ? cause you need that renewed you have some cream ? the cream is over the one over the counter for now what is over the counter ? the ky cream the vaginal cream oh i thought something was going to get my urge what about ? that s what i m talking about i want to see you back in three weeks you don t want to give me that yet ? not yet oh okay i want to see how you re doing for three weeks if you sleep
see if you get better and if you re not in pain and do you think you need something stronger for pain for your knee ? what do you think ? mm cause i don t want it to interact with what i m taking well i ll check for that i ll make sure it doesn t or else if you give me something for pain then i won t need that see the reason why i m taking his pain pill is because when i sit still for an hour and i get up and walk i can t hardly walk yeah did you take the pain every day the pain pill every day ? i m supposed to but i haven t you want to try taking it every day because sometimes they would make me sleepy too sleepy okay okay ? but it s a once a day right ? well couldn t you take it at night ? okay and what i would take them both together ? yeah absolutely will i be too sleepy ? at night ? no well then i won t take his what are you giving me ? i want to give you ambien milligrams you can take the anti inflammatory medicine at night you can take them all at night okay so what you ve given me is for sleep ? mm hmm alright and the pills he gives you you can take it at night also it says it may cause but it s a pain pill but that s okay take them both and see if you re pain is controlled the next day and if you sleep the night
it s all we re just trying it first okay ? x ray physical therapy blood work and i ll see you back in three weeks and see how you re doing and then we can okay so you ll give me a paper for physical therapy ? is it here ? mm mm i ll show you it s on the back of it it has all the addresses alright ? make sense to you now ?
good do you want a flu shot by the way ? okay good change your mind let me know mm hmm
all set ? there we go how are you ? this is m right ? k ? k oh i m sorry i saw the m and i was thinking uh and it sounds like you you got the consent pleasure to see you i don t think we ve met before no i usually right ? go to dr but they said he was out with some kind of surgery and he d be back in february so i wanted to get my physical done not a problem i m delighted to see you today okay and we ll we ll make sure we keep you in good shape um i m going to pull up the computer screen as we re talking okay and i have a ton of questions to ask you because i want to get you caught up on all the healthcare that you need but before i get started any specific concerns or is everything okay ? um physically okay
okay physically now do you want to have a seat over here be more comfortable ? no i m okay you re okay where you re at ? yeah my son was killed oh i m sorry to hear that when did this happen ? six weeks ago right down the street here how old was he ? twenty one that s a horrible thing to have to go through is is this um have you like sought any counseling or been getting any help with regards to this ? how about family members and friends ? have they been yeah have you ever had any problems with depression or anxiety or anything in the past ? okay so you ve been doing okay until this happened wow and i m doing okay now too it s just but it s still going to be hard can can i ask can i ask what happened ? what was the nature of what happened ? um all can figure is he just fell asleep he d been um working a lot he was working up in rochester and um he would pick up his girlfriend from work at two in the morning and so he was only getting a little bit of sleep like between seven and midnight and then he d get up and you know she d want to still stay up and be awake with him after that so i just don t think he was getting enough sleep and he ran off the edge of the road and hit a tree that s a horrible horrible thing to have to go through um do now whenever something like this you know happens to someone there s always a guilt that everybody kind of feels is that something that and i m not saying you should feel guilt i want no i do i do to kind of normalize that is that what what type of guilt do you feel right now that you re going through ? well i had been living in that apartment i let him stay in it and um just knowing that he wasn t getting enough sleep and you know there s a lot of different things just justify that yeah okay now a lot of times when things like this happen i think sort of anybody that s involved can kind of look at themselves blame themselves if only i had you know been a more strict parent and made sure that he d sleep if i d done this or that you know if only i had said before he went out on that particular day make sure that you you know keep an eye on the road but despite all that guilt that we had a lot of times within ourselves there s a rational side that will be able to say look realistically would a realistic person in this situation have done you know does a realistic person always remind a year old you know how old was he ? you said ? twenty one year old to get sleep because no year olds get sleep you know that right ? is there any rational side of you that that recognizes that this guilt oh yeah is kind of inappropriate and not yeah yeah correct ? i know and you know that s why i said you know overall you do ? oh yeah i recognize that okay good i i just want to make sure that you and i just go back and forth but you still have all those thoughts you still think about it you know my daughter does too and i m i m having a lot of you know i m just worried about my other two kids and how they re taking it which is natural okay ? and despite the okay so good so despite the guilt that you feel and there s nothing that we can do to really get rid of this there s no rational thoughts that or you know at least the rational side that recognizes that year olds will do what they do and and i mean we can keep everybody cooped up in the house all day and never live our life but unfortunately accidents happen so and you re still going to feel guilty despite that i recognize that um any thoughts of suicide yourself ? okay have you been able to i mean it s it s a good sign that you re at least here you know have you been able to get outside the house buy groceries yeah i ve been i ve been back to work and you re actually back to work okay oh yeah yeah good okay yeah i went back you know i needed to not think about it so i ve just been thinking about it in small little pieces you you re appropriately sad based on what happened in your life but would you find would you consider yourself so down and so depressed that um that that it s wrecking your life ? no ? okay because i m not a pill pusher but no it s just yeah i know i just want to make sure you know that there s things available for you yeah yeah i might talk to um the psychologist that he he had been going to just to find out you know some more things she knew about him and what s going on in his life just for that reason but um no i m more worried about my kids how they re dealing with it than than i am i think i m i m getting through it it s just when i have to it s just bringing it up you know i have a lot of clients that always ask me about my oh ! kids so it you know it s like a constant everyday thing somebody new doesn t know about it do you when when these and you have to almost have a game plan going in like because you know that people are going to ask you about it probably on a daily basis is your game plan to discuss it or is your game plan to kind of push it aside ? because i think it s fair to push it aside if that s what you need to do at work yeah well everybody that s new you know everybody that s new i don t say anything but with people that i ve known for years that you know i i feel guilty if i don t tell them yeah yes i guess you kind of have to in that situation but i think it s fair to as you said not bring it up to anybody else because you re dealing with it in your own way but you don t have to deal with it every second of every day you know what i m saying ? it s okay okay so from a kid s standpoint i think it s fair also to aggressively push your kids for counseling if they haven t gone for it oh my son my son is like an impossible case for that he s just totally non communicative and he won t be you know we ve tried to have him see people before because he had some problems in school but um he s a senior this year too and he just turned last friday mm hmm and you know he just simply doesn t talk about it at all which different people react differently to different situations right ? so i can t necessarily blame him for that right ? that s just how his style is yeah that s we ve got to work within that um one thing i d encourage and even if they re not interested in counseling they got to everybody s got to have some social support which is probably even more important than counseling alright ? and as a family that sounds it sounds like you ve done this you ve got to be there for your kids as you said right ? mm hmm i mean i don t know if he appreciates phone calls or does he live in this area or ? um he lives with me and okay lives with you good and my daughter is um she s going to oakland university she lives with her mother up in rochester okay so just the two of you live together now ? uh huh you and your your son okay um so it sounds like you re there at least so that way he has some kind of outlet does he have friends to yeah yeah he s got one friend that has come over several times and he goes over there alright even if he doesn t talk about it if he goes out if he if he keeps busy yeah i don t think he talked about it with anybody that s why you know it s i still wonder you know is it all of a sudden going to come out you know six months from now or something because he just doesn t he he probably will and he s going to have to address this in his own time and his own way but it s you know there s nothing we can really do to to to bring that on well let s see so it sounds like you ve had some tough some tough times obviously now i m looking at your chart and you ve otherwise been pretty healthy in the past you ve had kidney stones
and um maybe an enlarged prostate but besides that um and yeah besides that you ve otherwise been healthy no surgeries ?
uh right
and the medicines you take you take hydrochlorothiazide do you take this for the kidney stones for the kidney stones so not for blood pressure right ? now interestingly you re on you re on a pretty high dose at uh milligrams um yeah because i kept having them because you kept having them okay my dad has tons of them and they just really run in our family okay and and interestingly your blood pressure i mean it s it s normal but but obviously the stress that you re going through is probably raising it a little bit or causing it to rise a little bit but uh yeah it s been normal just about every time one thing that s very very important uh while you re on this medicine is it s very important to check the potassium level at least once a year because um hydrochlorothiazide can lower the potassium which can cause certain heart rhythm problems the last time yours was checked was in december of so it s been two years okay ? now why i m telling you this i just did want to mention too i i did notice i ve had like um a pain in my thigh and i m wondering if maybe it is like a cramp or something well we ll find out drinking a lot of water could help okay and certainly if your potassium is low we ll we ll we ll replete that but um certainly bananas you know at the very least try to consume a few of those oranges have a fair amount of potassium as well juice is not as healthy because its got a lot of sugar without the fiber okay ? but you do what you can there we ll find out okay ? now uh so the only medicines you take is the hydrochlorothiazide and the flomax okay do you take this flomax everyday ?
and uh no i see you re allergic to penicillin and sulfa what happens when you take these ? i get a rash okay dr m do a physical last year for you you said ? no i think i skipped it last year okay let s see if i can find it from last time because i can get some information from that and kind of review that with you um a lot of what we do during the physical is talking to get you caught up on everything and then we uh yeah there it is and then we uh do the exam okay um any diseases that run through the family like heart disease cancers or diabetes ? um well my grandfather had um some kind of cancer i think it was pancreatic but he was an alcoholic and um my grandmother on my dad s side had breast cancer and rectal cancer um my grandmother had died my other my mom s mom died of um she was really heavy her whole life so so were my parents um you know i think she died of congestive heart failure but everybody lived until their s anyway okay okay good so it sounds like you ve done so it sounds like your family overall has been pretty pretty good shape you know all things considered you know eventually so now uh you work as a something
i do yeah disability and worker s comp okay okay where do you work out of ? just right down across from the cadillac on uh down in plymouth ann arbor road and okay excellent do you enjoy it ? oh yeah yeah no i love it no so do you work for the state or is this no there s just my partner and i
okay and um very good now how about uh stress in your life ? you know even before all this happened have you been a pretty stressful person or have you been pretty taking things in stride ? i i do pretty good you know i had a really horrible divorce and child custody battle and okay okay which again brings up the the the concerning thing that we speak about are you on speaking terms with your wife your ex wife ? no ? now a little bit we weren t really before
okay okay now any smoking that you do ? okay how much do you smoke ? um about a half a pack a day okay any interest at any point in your life not today but any point in your life of quitting ? no i do want to quit and i tried to a couple times i i um i did back when i was like or to i smoked but never more than about a half a pack a day and then i quit you know between then and like three years ago during the divorce i started again okay which makes sense right ? i mean you go through a stressful time it s hard to stay away yeah okay here s the thing so you know smoking is bad cancers heart attacks et cetera okay um quitting smoking is challenging but can be done there s all kinds of pills and patches and everything and counseling programs that are out there to help you to do it but nothing will work unless you re percent mentally focused you know that right ? so you got to want to do it and you got to be in a situation and a position in your life when you re capable and ready to do it now is not the time okay and you know that if in the future at some point you re ready and i don t care whether it s a few months from now or even a year from now um we re here you know if you need our help you know chantix there s all kinds of medicines that are out there but i would you know this this may be the only time you ever hear a physician tell you this but i would strongly advise you not to quit smoking at this point okay ? because your chances of failure would be so high that you just don t want to have like another failure under your belt in a sense you know ? what are your thoughts on that ? i think that s good okay you think that s reasonable ? it s okay i mean if you can cut back fine if you can try to limit the number of cigarettes fine but to try to quit completely is is not realistic and this is not just based on my opinion but this is based on good studies that show readiness of behavioral changes you know that we need to stick with because we want to make sure that when we when we attack the smoking we re mentally focused and ready to go okay have you done it with pills or patches in the past ? um i i tried the um the gum like at the beginning of the year um before when i did it you know back in the when i was in my s i just quit okay i mean any one of them are fine there s a new medicine out chantix you may have heard of i ve heard of that yeah very good medicine um it really can double your chances of success and uh heck you know when you re ready let s let s give it a try okay we can do this in person or we can even do an e visit and again the same thing i m sure you know i know i know he s your doctor and i m sure he d be happy to discuss it with you as well um you you have internet access i imagine ? you go to henryford.com i m going to leave this over here for you to take home and um it s free for patients that have hap insurance everybody else has a co pay and you type in it takes about a week to get a password if you don t have one and um you can type in the you know smoking and it ll ask you a series of questions there ll be a space for comments at the end if you have a suggestion or a thought of a medicine you want to try or something it can be done over the internet or in person
okay so it s it s up to you shots the last time you had a tetanus shot was in you re up to date on that have you had a flu shot this year ? i did last week i had one
okay um so you re up to date on those things as far as blood work goes um i am going to recommend that chemistry panel which will include the potassium level now i also recommend a cholesterol panel in order to do this and a diabetic check and in order to do this we need you to be fasting for hours do you happen to be fasting today or ? looking at the watch which means last thing i had i probably had a like this much orange juice last night around o clock but i haven t that s good enough it s probably been hours that s good enough i mean to hours is fine orange juice is one of the worst things because it raises the blood sugar but yeah but i didn t have a whole lot but it was a long time ago so it ll be well out of your system by this point so we can check a chemistry panel which will include the potassium kidney function diabetic test and cholesterol i also recommend a psa which is the uh um prostate test okay ? that s recommended yearly at this point as well okay does the flomax mess that one up a little bit ? it shouldn t um flomax shrinks the prostate um but it shouldn t affect the psa okay maybe it was yeah they had me on another one before and uroxatral may you were on that one before or i m sorry avodart yeah there was another one i had been on avodart or maybe or something like that yeah yeah all those yeah those those are testosterone blockers that in theory can reduce the psa but um flomax shouldn t except to the point where if it s an enlarged prostate causing psa then it may drop it but that s not what we re looking for anyway we re looking for prostate cancer none of these tests are good i mean it s a lousy test for prostate cancer but it s the best we have
okay that s blood work have you had a colonoscopy ? no i have not okay over the age of is when they re recommended okay ? um what i can do if you re interested is fax a form over to the colonoscopy department they ll contact you to schedule it you know you can book it for a month from now whenever s you know whenever s a good time for you yeah i d like to do that very important test so um what i d do is i fax the form to them or medical system faxes the form if they uh if you don t hear from them within a couple of weeks because they re supposed to call you give us a call we ll find out why sometimes it falls through the cracks okay and we want to make sure that you don t fall through the cracks do you see the dentist and eye doctor on a regular basis ? okay and um dentist every six months eye doctor once a year right ? okay do you exercise ?
um not much lately okay but have you been not much this year okay so so although i did i did buy a new house and i did a lot this summer and actually i lost a lot of weight good i see that but now it s come back up again yeah keep keep going you know you re still technically a little bit overweight okay ? but even if you can keep the weight off and not gain it back mm hmm that s going to be uh a good thing okay ? yeah i m going to start going back to the gym i had i had gotten you need that now in great shape about four years ago during the divorce actually i got in great shape and psychologically it s going to keep you strong slowly gone back yeah as well okay ?
do you have an advanced directive or a living will ? uh no i don t okay let me give you some information on that and heck as a lawyer you may have your own paperwork but this is not the type of law you practice so no it s not i ll leave this over here it tells your family members what to do if you shouldn t be able to make decisions for yourself i mean there s forms to be filled out and we can scan them in the computer but it s more important that whoever you assign as your you know healthcare um designee you know is the one that uh knows what your wishes are because when it comes down to it when you re in the hospital that s who they speak with we re not digging through all these forms okay ? um any concerns about sexually transmitted diseases ? okay okay let me uh take a look at you i apologize that my hands are cold
it s okay
it s the price we pay for washing them with alcohol and keeping them clean right ? mm hmm let s take a look at your nose here open wide stick your tongue out actually let me tilt your head down and say ah let me get a tongue compressor there you go and say ah again your tonsils were out in the past ? um yeah i had for sleep apnea oh okay i m going to put that all down in your surgery for surgeries oh yeah i forgot i had that yeah when did i do that ? probably maybe in that area okay do you have problems with sleep apnea now ? uh i don t think i do anymore that s another reason i decided to lose all the weight i did a lot better when i didn t have all the weight which makes sense did you ever have to use that cpap machine ? i did and it was worthless worthless because you didn t like it or because it just well because i didn t like it it s very hard to sleep with well i can imagine i don t think i d like that either take a deep breath and out and again again and again you ever get chest pain or shortness of breath ? no not really okay excellent heart and lungs sound great squeeze my fingers really really tight okay and let go hold your arms up like this push up real hard real hard real hard push down excellent kick your legs out toward me both legs no kick the legs out towards me straighten out your legs i should say back toward you toes up and toes down excellent okay and just rest your legs now let s check your circulation pretty dry skin as most of us do in the in the winter time but it s not necessarily harmful okay you do have decent circulation in the feet one of the worst things you can do for circulation is of course smoking
so when you quit the smoking that ll you to actually improve somewhat
lift this up and check your belly first let me have you lie back now on your back i did have some abdominal pain over the past couple weeks but it s gone away now finally but i always attribute that to probably a kidney stone going on even though i never see them afterwards but every once in a while i do but any blood in the urine ? any constipation or diarrhea ? okay the stress can cause it as well but but it s it s very similar to pain that i had before that you had before now now with with kidney stones okay so no no you can sit up with kidney stones the concern is that they obstruct one of the the canals mm hmm and cause of backup of of water in the kidney has that ever happened to you before ? yeah i ve had to go to the emergency room several times i d never had to have one surgically removed or anything was it because of pain or inability to urinate ? um inability to urinate and there was blood in the urine so you ve had so many stones it sounds like we don t need to to make you glow by exposing you to so much radiation to do an x ray every time you have one right ? especially if they re minor but those obstructions are what worry us so if the pain becomes unbearable um or if uh you re not urinating that could be a sign that the stone is actually obstructing and it s causing water on the kidney known as hydronephrosis which is potentially dangerous so that s when you d need a you know a work up uh or sometimes that could even be a sign of an infection coming on okay so but um now is when i do the testicular and the rectal exam
so pull the curtain so let me get you to stand up and if i can have you face me and but with the colonoscopy by the way everybody uh complains about the prep uh huh okay but you don t necessarily mind the uh colonoscopy itself oh okay okay i m just going to check for any lumps or bumps here okay let me have you cough and cough again put your hands over on the side here there are some tissues for you okay this should be not painful but it may be uncomfortable okay ?
you ve had this before right ? feel some gentle pressure i m just going to check the end of the colon and we re all set okay ? have you uh um what was i going to ask ? have you have you do you have any symptoms of uh increased urination ? because your prostate does not feel large to me i know they never they never say it does and they did they actually did the um what do you call the test where they take a scope right down into it and into the prostate do an ultrasound or something ? no no they the scope through the penis and down in oh cystoscope yeah yeah they actually did that yeah i got myself a couple years ago oh um they did that and it s all up right at the at the opening to the prostate or the opening to the bladder is where it s they said that it s enlarged up in there and that s where the restriction is of the flow is coming from or something like that maybe he s got which makes sense which makes sense okay so yeah because they they never really noticed it well i m glad we re all saying the same thing which is good right ? okay but i really once if i stop taking those pills for like even one day i i ve had terrible problems urinating i mean incredibly slow and incredibly start and stop and especially if i take any decongestant or anything like that then i can t go period okay which is common for that
decongestants can cause that okay um okay so so you re in great shape okay ? and your exam looks uh fabulous the the keys for you obviously your your mental health you re going to work on that okay ? it sounds like you re doing as well as you possibly can given the circumstances the um smoking you know when you re ready for that when you re psychologically strong we ll tackle that okay ? um the blood work um i do recommend blood work and it sounds like you re in agreement with that okay and um uh fasting blood work it takes about a couple days to come back as soon as i get the results i send you a letter if there s anything urgent of course we give you a call i do recommend a colonoscopy and it sounds like you re in agreement with that as well and um that s pretty much it okay ? so i ll step out of the room you can get dressed but you ll be good for a year if everything is normal okay ? um and any other questions for me ? no i think that s it we re here for you for anything else you need okay ? have a good day

okay and uh you how are you doing with your headaches at this point ? are they um no nothing s changed much uh huh how often do you get the headaches ? well about um in the month of april beginning of may i went for almost five weeks with a migraine wow okay and you just continuous headache or does it come and go during that period ? well yeah it was no that was that was almost everyday and that s when they started switching the topomax again and we just got it switched back up to the milligrams and it was at uh huh and that s when it was that was almost the continuous five weeks of a migraine and it was from the colognes it s from the smells uh huh we ve narrowed it down to that uh huh um and that s why i m not asking you to switch any of that or look at any of that or my blood pressure sure sure yeah i know i know you already have an appointment you know you see um uh dr m is it m ? m yes and um yeah he s trying to control that and you know i i mean that part of it and i m keeping in touch with him so um and we re and he s trying very hard to control it with me and i m keeping in touch with his secretary and he right now i think he s out of town uh huh but she s keeping in touch with him by email and uh so far at the end of may through the beginning of june i ve only had two okay okay and one of them was yesterday and i m still on the down side of it so it s doing better um i ve only had two of them since since the last week of may and yesterday okay alright so since they ve upped the topomax back up to so it it is getting and i think if we can keep that up i m hoping absolutely now um the medications on the list here i see you re also taking zocor ? that s for your cholesterol right ? okay and uh we haven t had uh um a blood draw on that probably in a year so we might want to do that absolutely have you had anything to eat yet today ? okay anything to drink at all ? a sip of pepsi diet pepsi okay okay so we ll go ahead and so i m probably good for that one eah we can certainly do that and uh let s do you know we ll check the cholesterol and check your blood sugar values as well as a liver test since you re on the uh cholesterol medication okay ? yeah yep
alright and the other thing that i want to uh also check with you was um do you drink any alcohol ? very little not often okay and do you drink once a week less than that ? no less than that less than that ? once a month ? uh probably less than that less than that ? it s occasional sure and when you do have uh an alcoholic drink do you um do you ? maybe one a glass of wine okay any history of drug use at all ? just the stuff they keep putting me on prescription drugs
sure not you re not taking anything for high blood pressure ? yes i am you are ? okay it s an n the ? okay because the is sometimes used just for um the migraine prevention also he s using it as both as both ? okay alright as both i bet um your blood pressure doing pretty well right now so that is uh not a concern but i just wanted to clarify that because some people do take it uh only for the migraines he s doing it as both
so that s uh that why i thinking any problems with your vision or hearing that you ve noticed ? why i noticed that there was there s some history of an optic nerve uh problem uh what s the status with that ? it stays in it hasn t changed in years kay alright there s still no central vision uh huh the left eye is it ? in in the left and it s coming up in the end of june for an uh goldman field visual with dr s

uh and uh um is there any family history of any type of cancer or heart problems that you know of ? the cholesterol runs in the family uh huh um the um heart problems no okay any cancers you re aware of ? cancers yes my um my mom s mom had breast cancer uh huh um my dad s brother had i and i didn t tell the gyn this yet monday uh leukemia
okay okay now when you went to gyn did they do a pap smear again this time ? yes well they did an internal exam ? i don t have i have hysterectomy hysterectomy right uh huh he did the the regular checks checked a regular uh and did did they do an internal examination as well ? okay did they give you uh a request to go ahead and get the mammogram done as well ? because i saw you had one and a bone density and a bone density ? he does it every year we do it a year okay because i noticed that you had one last year mammogram but i just didn t see one this year so i just assumed uh you probably we do it i do i down here because it s easier because i work here okay sure sure okay and the bone density she wasn t out there this time and i m going to have one done again because it s been two years okay alright two years okay alright and uh did you have any problems on your bone density ? okay alright that was at the first one was uh just a i don t know what it s called the what s the word just the the like a baseline ? okay alright okay alright just a base line okay alright i was giving you the no that s okay um and um what kind you said you work here ? is that ? yeah i do inpatient billing npatient billing ? okay and um do you um do like a breast examination ? yes i do once a month okay do you you do once a month ? okay and have you noticed anything unusual ? do you also check to see if there s any discharge also aside from the uh uh looking for the swellings ? okay excellent and um really speaking you know um the only other type of cancer screening that really uh is um necessary at your age is the colon evaluation okay ? do you know something about that ? uh i ve heard about it i just ooh it was brought up last year and i didn t get it done okay now as you probably know already it s typically we start at age on that okay ? and now there are different ways of doing it okay ? i mean you know the they sent one in the mail okay ? uh huh uh huh i don t know who sent it uh huh but it was they just sent it in the mail and i haven t had time to do it you those little cards is that what you re talking about ? i think so okay alright i i opened it i d seen what it was i put it back in there and set it down okay okay same as i did with the paperwork for the consent thing for the okay i see i see um it s just been a busy time for me sure sure i know i need to get it done uh huh um i i just keep putting it off i i understand how that can happen you know do you have those cards still with you at home would you ? it s at home yeah ? um would you like me to give another set uh you have or you ? no i will do it so that i mean that obviously is almost i can say the simplest way okay it s just a dreadful thing to i i understand you know but of of the various tests we have that is probably the easiest one the easiest one yeah now that is something though uh because of the fact that it s not as sensitive why i heard that there s polyps that run in the family family side right ? okay alright now the one problem with the um the cards is that you know we really um they re they re useful only if you have a polyp or some other growth which is actually bleeding okay ? in the sense that you know we re detecting microscopic amounts of blood so we re not basically and if you came and told me you were having blood in your stool it s no longer a critical discussion we d be having so basically this is to be use in a situation where we re not really seeing anything where they may be there in microscopic amounts and that s basically what we re trying detect the limitation obviously is the fact that it had to bleed so you could have a polyp sitting there which is not bleeding which we may not pick up okay nevertheless we do know that in patients you still need a you still need it it s still and so like i said the simplest would be those the next uh couple of measures you know there is where you actually go in and take a look and also uh recommended you know uh but if i can see that you have some hesitation even with the sending the stool cards in so let s at least start there you know i think um it does need to be like a i say i said earlier it does need to be done every year with the full colon test you know typically everything is negative we don t need to do it except every years okay ? and certainly i would again you know just let you know if you do notice any blood in the stool it is certainly something that you need to be coming in to have checked out um for sure okay ?

yeah so you re here for a physical right ?
okay so we got to check up on some stuff alright ? like your mammogram
yeah i haven t had one of those and also i had a little incident here and i don't know if i had i have trouble with my hand and you know i fell a couple years ago and i never had it x rayed or anything but i m having a lot of problems right here in my rib area like what do you feel ? ah pain and if i turn like a certain way i get stuck you know and it s like to the point where it s really hurting it just doesn t feel right over here
okay um so let s do let s um look at the preventive stuff first and then um then we can look at the other stuff is that okay ? mm hmm okay so last mammogram that i can find that you did was in july of sound about right ? yeah so you re kind of overdue for that you should have one every one to two years and i i tell people one because then if you if you re a little late or whatever you re still you know you re still getting screened on a regular basis um so you need to do that so i m going to give you a form okay ? and you can stop at the desk um and radiology downstairs and they can set it up for you you can call back and set it up we do them here we do them at evenings they can work around your work schedule or or whatever you need to okay ? mm hmm it s a promise ? heh heh scouts honor ? does that work ? oh yeah so that s that s what this one is for
it s all about me from now on i m i m liking that yeah my friend passed away and so i don t have to take care of her no more and just me i don t even have a family anymore ? why ? what do you mean ? i chose to drop i m just by myself they were bad for you ? mm hmm is that part of the reason you weren t taking care of yourself ? well i was running around doing everything for everybody else you know mm hmm and ah so yeah they re i m by myself now you had a boyfriend right ? still do ? same guy ? oh yeah what do you mean sometimes then ? you know i don't know i really don t want to have a boyfriend over i don t want i want to be by myself i want to be totally by myself so was he not he s not good for you either ? he s okay so where s all this i want to be by myself come from ? is that um i don't know cause i m not depressed i take that stuff there that fluoxetine but you know maybe that s not working anymore you know i ve been on it for a long time does it stop working ? sometimes yes sometimes no cause i don t think i can go any higher on it no you can t do you i mean do you have depression symptoms ? like what ? a lot lately like what ? like i could sleep hours the only reason i get up to go anywhere is to go to bed i mean go to work mm hmm you know everybody thinks i sleep too long but i mean i could sleep all day long mm hmm how s your night time sleep ? well i work midnights mm hmm so two nights three nights a week i work four four midnights a week and the other three i have no problem i could sleep all day long so when you work midnights what time do you go to bed ? when i get home i usually go to bed around o clock o clock in the morning ? mm hmm and then what time do you get up ? it just depends and then on the days when you don t work do you stay with the same schedule ? pretty much but you know i i find myself crawling in bed and sleeping although lately i would say well i probably do stay on the same cause i was going to say lately i don t sleep that well mm hmm you know up down up down so cause when you when you work a midnight shift you know it s good to stick with the same schedule when you re off because it s really hard on your body you know if you re sleeping at different and you never really get used to it and that can trigger a lot of things in terms of fatigue you know ? yeah cause i m tired all the time yeah the other thing that s it makes it harder to sort out are you depressed or not depressed is that because you re not taking care of yourself that you know when your blood sugars are off and you re not exercising you re not eating right you ll feel tired from all of that stuff too right yeah cause you know like doctor sometimes i feel like i m confused you know like this appointment today you know i m thinking and it s here it was but if find myself doing that even at work you know i used to be you know right on things and you know i think well did i take that blood pressure did i do this ? and i have to go back and double check i find that a lot lately you know it s like i wonder if i had a small stroke ? what by lately how what do you mean ? i d say in the last month mm hmm maybe even two months okay what about other depression symptoms like um are you able to enjoy yourself ? you know are jokes as funny as they used to be ? do you enjoy people that you used to enjoy ? um you know i don't know a funny commercial on tv anything that you might have laughed at are you finding things as humorous or as fun ? i don t find anything that humorous anymore no ? you know ? i mean but i don t think you know like i m not ready to kill myself or anything like that mm hmm you know how s your motivation ? i don t have any mmm so should tell give me an example like what way ? motivation ? i d rather just go to bed than deal with anything like when i when i say i m sleeping i m sleeping pretty much all the time do you get other feelings like oh do you feel hopeless or helpless powerless that kind of thing ? yeah maybe a little helpless how long have you felt like that ? you know these these kinds of things ? you know it s hard to say maybe about three four months
when did the eye thing happen ? april st of i woke up like that okay so it doesn t coin coincide with that um well tell me are you exercising at all ?
oh i haven t been no you know i hurt too much i hurt i mean my bones hurt i don't know if this is arthritis or what but my fingers hurt my wrists hurt to the point of just you know now that i notice i m starting to get like a lot of pain like right in here you know like i just hurt my toes hurt where they meet into the feet mm hmm you know the only thing that doesn t hurt on me are my ah knees well that s a good thing you know so you re not doing any exercise at all ? ah you know a little bit here and there i might lift a couple weights but you know i think didn t we talk about water exercise before ? mm mm well you know what ? water exercise is really good for people who are hurting you know ? it s good for people who have arthritis or are overweight or just have those those issues where the idea of walking on a treadmill or doing a stationary bike or whatever is just like ouch that just sounds like it would hurt too much ah cause the water will kind of it buoys you up and gives you support but it also gives you resistance so you when you re exercising in the water it can be extremely good for you where do you do it at ? where do you find water ? where do you find water ? where do you live ? in warren well then that s really easy the warren community center off of library yeah they have a pool and they have water exercise classes in that pool mm hmm okay they also have what they call the lazy river it s a river that s like with a tide and i have a lot of patients who walk the lazy river you can walk with the flow or against the flow if you want more resistance so just walking in the water and you re not getting the pounding on your joints and the warmth of the water is soothing so you do the exercise class you can swim or you can do the walking in there i think you should check it out because um you know you re at that point where you you got to start focusing on yourself like you were saying when you when i walked in you know you got to it s got to be all about you
um because nothing s going to get better if you keep doing things the way you ve been doing them mm hmm you know ? so
now do i have arthritis ? how can you check ? well we can check by it it s at work it s even getting you know and that s the only thing i do is work and even work is just getting to be sometimes by the time i leave there you know it s like you re hurting ? you might have arthritis i mean there are different kinds of arthritis so to you know we can check like with an x ray of a particular joint that is hurting a lot i wouldn t x ray every single thing that hurts because that s just too much radiation you know you know you don t need that but there be some clues on x rays as to what kind of arthritis a person might have um we can also do blood work that can check for rheumatoid and other kinds it s basically in my hands i notice it s getting into my wrists it s you know sometimes i just go to bed because the pain is so bad i just you know go to bed and i sleep with gloves on cause the warmth tends to yeah it sure sounds like it doesn t it ? but i mean it s like everywhere and it s not just a little pain it is i m in pain and tylenol roger had me using that tylenol arthritis i use two bottles that doesn t touch it it doesn t ? motrin i can do as long as it s s really upset my stomach and then after a couple weeks of them my i kind of lay off are you talking prescription motrin or do you just take three or four of the over the counter ? it depends on what i have now dr wrote me out a long a large prescription for motrin when i was there how many milligrams for that one ? six hundred cause i know i can t take more than so the can help you ? the bothers your stomach ? yeah yeah the thing with medicines like ibuprofen is um they including affecting your stomach like you you um felt that s when the medicine is like um it s dissolving in your stomach and can irritate your stomach but it can also predispose you to ulcers it can also affect your kidneys and i do think i have an ulcer and but so medicines like but with the ibuprofen and you already have diabetes it s not controlled you can end up hurting your kidneys really badly and pushing yourself into renal failure can we check for that ? we got yes we will definitely check for that okay so i want you to check everything dr do you still have some ibuprofen at home ? i have a prescription i can get filled dr the ophthalmologist gave it to you ?
okay um so you said you think you have an ulcer ? based on ? um well basically like when i drink coffee mm hmm as soon as i drink that coffee mostly i i want to throw up you know it just kind of and i find that feeling that like nauseated feeling or like ah it almost feelings like i m hungry but i know i m not type of in my stomach but yes but just when you drink coffee ? coffee really does anything else do it ? um i don t eat hardly any like spicy foods like i used to like that stuff that all just bothers my stomach like really bad same kind of feeling ? um ehh just like a burning burning mm hmm does if you feel hungry does your stomach hurt ? kind of not not hurt as much as it feels nauseated kind of like a like i m always walking around feeling nauseated it seems mmm really ? coffee really makes it so you re nauseous hungry or not hungry whether you ve eaten or not eaten and it s just especially bad with coffee ? is that right ? mm hmm so i really did switch a lot to tea but i notice even the tea is just starting to cause but i m drinking like three and four cups of tea a day yeah you know what ? i haven t seen you since can you believe that ?
yeah i can because you know i can never get in here i m discouraged ah you ve seen i ve seen i don't know how i got in here today because last time i called i called for something and they told me that i had no ah there were no um i couldn t get in to see you till april or may and then you managed to get into and then i managed to see and they told me it d be the end of january so i called in between there for something i don t even know remember what it was
and something opened up well here s the thing though okay um we we need to get you back on track right ? mm hmm and we need to make sure that you re getting all the preventative stuff done that you need to get done right ? like your paps smear and your mammogram and your screening blood work and since you re over we have to do the colon cancer screening thing too yeah because the last time i was here for that was awhile back cause that s what my mom died of i remember they sent me out um they thought i had a heart attack did you get you never got the colonoscopy though did you ? no after that i just never okay right i never found the time
so because you have so many things going on in your life and with your health issues and stuff like that i think we re going to have to do a step by step kind of approach you know ? so um today we ll focus on doing the screening tests that you need and um and checking up on the blood work that s related to your diabetes your blood pressure all of those kinds of things and your ah cholesterol and all of that and then um have you commit to doing a couple things and then we ll have you come back in a month okay ? because i think that you probably need to come in regularly for awhile alright ? fine with me as long as i can get in here yeah we ll just schedule you on when you re on your way out okay ? so that you can you know have that
cause you know i don t trust doctors that much i like you and i don t want to change but yeah i got to be able to get in here mm hmm you know so let s do that does that sound okay ? alright and then maybe between now and when you come back you ll commit to doing a couple things for me okay ?
like getting the mammogram like would you check out the water exercise class or the water whichever appeals to you and start doing that ?
i ll check into it yeah maybe i can get somebody to go with me i feel step one is checking into it weird going into water well you know what everybody in a bathing suit everybody tells me i don t want to go into a bathing suit you know and all this jazz and then they go and guess what ? everybody looks like you okay hey that would be great ! it s not all the people who are you know at lifetime and stuff everybody s in the same boat they re dealing with health issues and nobody s caring you know if somebody s carrying a few extra pounds or not okay ? so that that kind of helps once people once you get there and you realize oh wait a second you know i m i fit in you know i fit in here there s a big girl okay right right so you get there and you got to remember you said you got to do stuff for you right ?
so um so we ll get get um those those two things done the mammogram the water exercise we ll do some other stuff today and your paps smear too and then tell me what you re doing with your diet
well i you know basically i follow i do pretty good until like when i m just sitting around doing nothing i m eating you know i mean i m eating i m eating like apples and fruit and all that but i m eating much more than probably than i should be you know that kind of stuff when you went to see did that help you with that kind of eating ? to help you stay on track a little bit it did but yeah at that time i was supposed to go see that dietician again and then that s when everything started and i didn t i didn t make it back i haven t been there since probably february or something like that
mm hmm well you know it sounds like before you were like you were taking care of everybody else so you were ignoring yourself okay ? now you re not taking care of them so you can take care of you right ? um but it sounds like there s still maybe something else that keeps you from really taking care of yourself and maybe it s depression but but you re you re eating out of boredom right ? that s one thing that you said um are there any other things that make you overeat or not pay attention to your diet ? no like you know when people are you know when i m upset i eat people say awhh when you re bored you eat when you re upset you eat ? you know people are like oh how d you lose all that weight ? oh i was depressed i didn t eat for a long time well not me like i wish right ? you know like i don t eat you know candy with sugar in it i eat sugarless candy but i eat probably too much of it you know that kind of stuff
okay alright the colon cancer thing um your mom died from colon cancer ? yeah how old was she ? ahh how old was my mom ? i think she was when she passed away ? yeah oh that s you know i had so i guess we re in that ballpark yeah and your dad had lung cancer ? mm hmm
alright so colon cancer screening for you is really important right ? because when with the colonoscopy in particular when they take a look in there they look for little polyps that they re not cancer yet but they can turn into cancer over time so if they go in and they look and it s clean then you re good you don t have to be rechecked for another ten years but if they go in and they find polyps and they re the kind that into cancer then depending on how many and which type then they ll do it again in three years or five years to make sure that you never get the colon cancer right ? so you get the polyps out before they can grow up to be cancer is basically what what you re trying to do um there are different ways we can screen and stool cards are one way you ve probably heard people just doing stool cards you know check for blood in the stool you can t see um there s flexible sigmoidoscopy which scopes the lower third of the colon and there s colonoscopy which looks at the whole colon in your particular case the colonoscopy makes sense you have a family history of colon cancer we really need to take a a look at the whole colon get the polyps out if they re there find out what kind they are but that will be something that it would be important for you to commit to doing you don t have to have the colonoscopy between now and the next time you see me but if you can call them and they ll set you up for it you know so you make that step you re hurting right now huh ?
mm hmm i can tell yeah so you ll have a few things on your list to do when you leave okay ? and then when you come back we ll ah you know just see where you re at with those things at some point
and you know i do get a lot of yeast infections i know yeah you know why though ? the blood sugars i know i know that s what it is yeah
yeah yeah so um oh went over these medicines with you right ? yeah but you know i don t think she had the hydrochlorothiazide on there i don t remember her asking me that i put the ones on there that i m going to need refills
the um the fluoxetine for depression i think we re um yeah what should i do about that ? keep taking it ? you re taking three right now right ? um it certainly sounds like you still need it but maybe you need to switch to something else you know ? because it s not it s not doing as much for you anymore it s just truthfully really hard to sort out how much of what you feel is depression and how much of what you feel is you know you re not well mm hmm physically and you need to start taking those baby steps to improve that you know ? and some things will will sort out so should i just keep on that for how about if we stick have you stick with it for the next month and then we can re evaluate it ? does that sound alright ? mm hmm okay so you probably don t need a refill on oh wait a second maybe you do actually cause you re taking three a day yeah okay and then lisinopril we have on there so are you taking the lisinopril every single day ?
and did you take it this morning ? i didn t take anything this morning yet what time do you usually take them ? i usually take my pills in when i get home from work in the morning okay so you re late right now right ? do you usually i didn t work last night i called in so i wouldn t miss the appointment then i m minutes late anyway so since you haven t taken them yet you normally would have taken them when you when you get home you said ? so like between and o clock nine ? um cause you re blood pressure is really high today i know but i think it s because you know the snow you know like all the way here you know i even had a friend drive me and plus you didn t take them yet i was a nervous wreck and the snow i didn t take them yet today i just okay so the cozaar you re taking ? cause my blood pressure my blood pressure is not usually that high mm mm you re taking both of them right ? the lisinopril and the cozaar ? yup and then the hydrochlorothiazide nd you take them all in the morning ? isn t that got a blood pressure in it too ? yeah mm hmm it s ah technically a diuretic or water pill but it s um it helps with the blood pressure yeah i don t think she had that one on the list yup it s there oh is it okay yeah you need a refill on that one too huh ? mm hmm okay how much lantus are you taking ? i it says on there mm hmm but when i was at the last time i think him and i went up to so what have you actually been doing ? okay and how many times a day are you checking sugars ? three and four times did you bring your with you ? no i didn t no ? nobody ever asks to look at it anyway i am usually i take my pills every time and nobody asks even to look at my pills two bottles of metformin ? no you know what ? the other one is i don't know what it is i got to ask the pharmacy when i go it s either i think they either switched the cozaar i don t know what that is down there i had to use the bottle for something uh oh you mean you have you don t know if you have ah i haven t been taking them what s this doctor proof ah lid here ? that s metformin there in your hand the big old honker ones ? yeah i take two of those a day and you don t know what these are ? well it s either ah it s one or the other it s either simvast it s something but they changed the brand how come i m confused why is it in your metformin bottle ? because i had to use i needed a little bottle for something so i went ahead and um poured those in there cause it was an extra bottle now i really can t remember what they re for so you are you taking the simvastatin ? mm hmm
okay what about the flexeril ? what s up with that ? i had a pulled muscle so i was taking those i don't know who gave them to me maybe and then what every once in awhile i do take them like if i you know like i come home and i got a pulled muscle i take them for like three nights in a row and it seems to clear up the pulled muscle
okay and then um i have also ranitidine and i m out of that and i really do need it i bought some zantac over the counter it doesn t seem to help as good it s a lower dose but um i ve been taking that cause i do get a lot of lot of lot of heartburn
now this is um a cough pill yeah i kept those because when i was sometimes i get a cough really you know i haven t maybe you know i don t take those all the time but i was having a really bad cough and so somebody prescribed them and i just keep them just in case i ever need them like on those days when i m coughing really really hard and i can t get rid of it so these are from april of so you re going to want to toss them in april okay you re used to that
so you ran out of the ranitidine now has your stomach been bothering you more since you ran out of it ? you know what ? now that you re saying that could be ?
could be cozaar these are the refill ones simvastain lantus cozaar hydrochlorothiazide and i may need syringes and the ah pen needle things cause if you don t write the prescription out they don t give it to you okay where do you get them from ? you get it all from walgreens ? yup that s my pharmacy okay you taking the aspirin ? when i remember
and the novolog you don t have that with you ? it s in my purse i keep a in my purse i could probably use a prescription for that too what are you i mean ah how much ? ah anywhere between and it depends on what i m eating do you count your carbs ? that was the only good thing my boyfriend was good for cause he made all the meals and the lunches and all my stuff was counted out so with you counting the carbs and taking the insulin and your sugars are still high ? whatever happened with the symlin that dr prescribed ? well i ll tell you i started it taking it there for awhile it never i never really ah seemed to do that much for me and then it got to be too much of a thing to take you know it didn t and it really didn t i wanted me to go downtown to see ah whoever it was i see down there yeah it was dr yeah even though i ve never seen him i ve seen nurses and ah yeah i can t find my way down there that much i don t really like going down to detroit and stuff but you re okay with going back to um ? yeah if he ll take me back okay he will he will okay so let s see um surgery wise just your tonsils is that and the eyes the eyes the laser eyes anything else ? mm hmm and i had a thing removed here a cyst before mm hmm okay family history we ve got the colon cancer in your mom and the lung cancer in your dad anything else ? no and um oh they found out my mom was a diabetic when she went to the doctor i never knew that
mm hmm and your weight s crept up just a last time i did a physical on you you were at was i this time ?
two thirty three okay um you re up to date on your um tetanus cause we took care of that when you were here last did you get a flu shot when you were here last time ? i mean did you get a flu shot this year ? work work gives them yeah so you got a flu shot this year at work okay do you know the date ? maybe just before thanksgiving okay in november ? okay um you have not had a pneumonia shot but we could actually make a case for you getting one the pneumonia shot it protects against um a type of um bacteria that causes a real high percentage of pneumonias and it seems to me i had that shot how often do you get it ? you don t get it very often you d get it when you re at age but you get it earlier if you have risk factors which you do what if i already had it ? would getting another one ? no big thing no oh okay well then i ll take one of them i kind of doubt it we haven t given it to you so no ? mm mm well then nobody else did you ve had your tetanus once with us and some of your flu shots okay ? you get your ah tb screenings through your work too right ? yeah okay so then anyway with the pneumonia shot it protects against the bacteria that causes a lot of the pneumonia that s out there and the important thing is that pneumonia is becoming resistant to antibiotics so it s a good one to not get i ll take one oh don t get it ? no it s it s good not to get that pneumonia so getting the vaccine is good okay it doesn t prevent every single type of pneumonia but it sure improves you know your chances so um can you think of anything else ?
no i just want to make sure that you x ray my hand cause i think it s the right one is the worst one ? you know i i got into a little scuffle and i bent my hand back with a patient ? yeah and i think that um i think that i don t know if it s out of place or what it swelled up real bad i soaked it and all of this turned like red and it s yeah it bothers me it bothers me a lot especially in the night like pulling and lifting everybody you know and by that third night second night i m just
and i forgot you said you are fasting this morning ? you didn t fast ? alright well we we ah well just write up whatever and you know what when i leave work one day i ll just go straight over to ah i ll do a fast and i won t eat and then i ll just go over there well the alternative is we can do ah a cholesterol and what s called a direct ldl cause you don t need to fast for that so if coming back fasting is really really hard for you then we can do it today what what we won t get is we won t get triglycerides and we won t get a hdl but if you come back fasting we get all of it it s up to you well i just want to make sure you get done let s do it today
alright alright so should we have step out while i do your exam ? it doesn t matter she s not going to be you re going to have the curtain closed aren t you ?
okay alright i m going to take a look in your ears have you ever thought about um counseling ? you know to help with depression and motivation
well you sent me once when you first put me on that fluoxetine and ah they told me i was normal and i didn t have to come back cause everybody there was a little odd sitting in the waiting room it was like that s true but i m thinking really to help you to get on track and stay on track you know ? with the taking care of yourself
take a deep breath for me where it hurts cause it s really bad so you over here ? over here a little bit more over oh right around there huh ? does that hurt to touch ? yeah a little bit up a little higher yeah right in there yeah and this gets you when you re lifting patients too ? yeah well sometimes it depends on how i turn like even they only if i m trying to pull out and i turn all i don t want to do it cause it will do it if i turn a certain way and it s like i got to stand up you know to get rid or i got to do one of these cause it s almost feels like feels like ? yeah it almost feels like it s getting caught up underneath do you know what i m saying ? it almost feels like you know cause i ll be like ahh ! and then i ll jump up you know right yeah how long did you say that s been going on ? i fell on my th birthday off of a front porch mm hmm the day of it i wasn t drunk or anything well and then your work probably complicates things oh yeah did they teach you body mechanics ? oh yeah i i ve been there long enough to know all them you know do you follow it ? oh yeah you do ?
i m going to check for lumps is that okay ? so you mention not getting drunk on your th birthday do you drink at all ? no ? every once in awhile i might have a couple beers but i couldn t even tell you the last time i had a beer really yeah it s not so great for your blood sugar have you noticed that ? ah yeah well that s why i drink ultra well michelob ultra light if i do drink but i don t really drink
and you haven t taken up smoking ? chewing ? hey don t laugh i there are people who ladies ? if you don t ask you don t know cause they everything feel okay ?
yeah um drugs ? i do smoke pot occasionally mm hmm how come ? ehh it makes me laugh it relaxes me you know so that s what you re doing ? how often do you do that ? maybe once a week that s not so good for you in the sense that you know it kills brain cells and takes away motivation so yeah since motivation is
see i hurt a lot in here you got a lot of body pain don t you ? oh yeah a lot and you know and the thing is it s really there you know what i m saying ? it s not like i m making it up or it s really there
so when you come in in a month bring in your blood sugars too okay ? okay when do i go see again ? whenever you can get in getcha in oh okay you can just give him a call um do you think that besides okay you re saying that you re going to check out the um water stuff and get your mammogram you re going to call um gi to get your ah colonoscopy set up um and you don t have to have it completed before you come back to see me but just get it in the works okay ? when am i coming back here ? a month ?
um do you think that you could um lose four pounds in the next month ? a pound a week ? well i could try okay turn so that means when you re bored and you start to eat you have to correct yourself you know ? like i will try that
yeah and then we ll re evaluate your blood pressure when you come back because it s not normally like this and i think it might be because you didn t take your medicine plus all the other stuff going on so yeah i m like i got i got to sit up you getting a cramp ? yeah oh back here though this is over here funny too almost kind of numb ? can you feel this ? i can feel that feels not that so much yeah how about yup that one s fine that could be a diabetes right
why are you saying four pounds ? is that like normal ? a pound a week a pound a week it s just like a kind of seems like a reasonable amount you know not shooting for okay i m going to lose ten pounds you know cause and then get depressed because i didn t do it a pound a week is reasonable just by increasing your activity so if you re over there doing the water exercise and then you re you just cut out the boredom eating you know and i know that s hard but it s kind of like it starts with awareness right ? you know that you do it so um you live in warren anywhere ? so you can go there and push me in the water me push you in the water ! whether you like it or not nobody cares about me anyway
that s not true alrighty i m going to go grab um then if the room gets crowded is that alright ? yeah that s she s there and i m here i m waiting thank you did you hear me say i was going to go get ? no i just kind of been timing it figuring like it s gotta be about time
i m a little irritated i think i have ah a yeast infection oh do you like living on monistat nowadays ?
yeah i do constantly and them um like i got like aww that s too bad they told me to go to the nearest emergency room i m thinking well
okay you go ahead and lie back and we ll put your feet in here scootch down yup am i far enough ?
so the best chance you have for those um yeast infections is
yeah i know am i down far enough ? ha i m just like caught up in the i know the the curtain is funny it s not you it s no i think that when they clean the floors they don t put the back in the same spot oh um actually you got to scoot down just a little bit more okay ? that should do that should do just don t let me fall off can you imagine ! you d fall right into my lap yeah you re not going to fall off especially if you when we re all done scoot up the table before you sit up okay ? okay is it in ? yeah you can t feel it ? a little bit well that s good cause i m searching for your cervix and i m glad it s not bothering you that much mmm well maybe that s cause now i have well it does tend to make things well other times i didn t and i had a hard time during it does tend to make thing easier you know ? even that doesn t do anything
what s going on with your periods ? oh i didn t have a period from last february and then october i ended up you got one ? yeah october and november and i haven t had a period since oh okay so now i got to start all over right ? yeah you re not in menopause you re still peri peri you had your fingers crossed didn t you ? it s like they re gone ! you know they never really bothered me you getting hot flashes or anything ? you know what ? i think i do but doctor sometimes i can t really tell if i m having hot flashes or is it my blood sugar
oh i m not going to make you have a rectal because you re going to have your colonoscopy right ? right okay your right so i m not going to feel anything that they won t see so as long you go do that you ll be set they won t take her ah
okay scootch back now her thingy she s not taping any yeah it s still it s still running
am i okay now ? so do i have a yeast infection ? well you might it s
they wanted i guess you know they re trying to do research on on um you know how we address preventative issues and stuff oh okay
goodness gracious lady goodness gracious lady oh doctor i m i m not kidding i m in so much pain i don't know how much longer i m going to be able to do this
so i m going to check your blood and if you re if everything is looking alright then maybe the ibuprofen is okay but your stomach is bothering you so that s so i m going to prescribe the um the ranitidine again and then if ah when you come back in a month if you re still having stomach issues then we ll pursue that farther too okay ? so it ll be a step by step alright ? mm hmm
so let's see since we re going to do a a vaccine short sleeves or long sleeves today ? i got long long ? okay so you can get get the bottom half dressed if you want just leave the gown on top so we can get to your arm
and then um i ll give you the order for blood work so make sure you have that blood work within the next oh wait we re going to do it today ever mind my hand x ray in yup i m going to write all that stuff up okay ? thank you doctor
yeah hi ms a hi dr so you re here for a physical today ? good yes i am
um okay so i did i have a copy of your last year s physical and um i looked over your labs but we ll probably do labs well we ll maybe do labs today are you yeah i fasted you are fasting i haven t had anything to eat okay good for you and it s two o clock in the day good for you because i didn t want to come back i m sure you re hungry yes i am
um let s see so the main thing you re on treatment for is the blood pressure right ? okay now um are you are you still taking and toprol ? no not the toprol and why not the toprol ? because you know the last time we tried to get started on that i i started to feel sort of dizzy and light headed and i guess we never started but i know you explained to me how that is so much better for the heart now we can try it again you know we can try it at a lower dose maybe what did we have the last time ? we have i think it was oh was it only ? i thought it was let me see it was it was yeah i think it comes in a but i d have to check but you know the s i can just cut them in half if if you can if you can break that one in half yeah it s an which is the long acting version but i think you can if well does it have a line do you know ? if it has a line then you probably could well let me see how the pressure is um oh it s too bad today it was good when she checked because i didn t have anything to eat now i don t always get as low as they get but if i get that low then you might not need to do the toprol okay ? well you said the toprol was for the conditioning of the heart so not necessarily the pressure but my pressure truly has been yeah well being controlled the lisinopril is the one that s good for preventing the heart thickening which you have mm hmm so you re on that one and the toprol is more to prevent a heart attack but i m not sure if we can tell the pressure and your cholesterol s good and you don t smoke you may not need the toprol okay ? so we ll see uh and is there anything else that you take other than the the than that one blood pressure pill then ? not on a regular basis i just take you know my motrins for pain or okay motrin as needed and then and then my allergy medicine as needed uh does your stomach okay which which allergy medicine ? what was it um allegra or something like that ? not allegra it s the other one is it claritin ? no it was comparative a third it was loratidine ? loratidine okay as needed as needed uh and let s see something else oh regarding the heart uh did i ever say anything or did you ever hear anything about maybe taking a baby aspirin a day ? we didn t really discuss it uh huh it s probably not a bad idea because your um you have high blood pressure and i don t know do you still have periods or no ? so you re post menopausal and so for women who are post menopausal and men over a baby aspirin is probably not a bad idea i started taking one a couple years ago is that going to help the menopause or just no no no it s to help prevent a heart attack prevent a heart attack no it won t help it won t help the hot flashes i don t think okay okay but it s it s just a general preventative for heart attack and maybe for stroke as well okay ? so it s i usually recommend and i get the coated milligram it s like a what they used to call a baby aspirin mm hmm that s enough to lower risk okay ? without the toprol ? well the toprol that s a different situation but it it would help like the toprol though in a way to prevent heart attack mm hmm okay but i m going to check the pressure before i decide on the toprol um and let s see blood pressure was doing well last year mm hmm has not been diagnosed with coronary disease yeah in fact the cardiologist i looked back on his note he said he did not think you had coronary disease in other words heart blockages he thought that the main problem was the the thickened heart wall and the what they call hypertensive heart disease uh huh um let s see previous history uh uterine fibroids um lot of bleeding you had an procedure right ? mm hmm
to stop the bleeding are you getting a pap smear today ? mm hmm okay um
appointments are too hard to get to keep coming back yeah this is true usually you re best to set up the next one when you re leaving that way it s set up ahead of time now if you get sick though we should have same days available yeah okay i i think i came in this summer i didn t see you though yeah you saw k right for the allergies
um previous hospitalization was just for that and the only other one was for the birth right ? mm hmm
childbirth and one miscarriage um let s see you wear glasses for near sightedness right ? mm hmm so you can see with to read without them probably uh huh i can about see where you are
okay and let s see non smoker did smoke some in the past how how much did you smoke in the past ? probably you know teenagers experimenting i don t know oh just that ? like you didn t smoke like a half pack or a pack a day ? no just that uh uh no no
and then alcohol just occasional wine ? mm hmm i still like me a glass of wine in the afternoon sometimes
and that s alright no other drug use um i see you had lost some weight last year how about now ? do you think it s up down or similar ? it s probably about the same from the scales out there i didn t see any difference but from last year two pounds more so pretty basically you re pretty close um do you uh do you exercise ? mm hmm okay that s good what kind do you do usually ? usually i walk and do the um the treadmills the stepper mm hmm and then lift a little bit of weight in the gym with the fellows that s good and how often do you do it about ? um usually about three times a week okay um the weights three times a week would be enough and the walking and the others you might want to do something on the off days a little bit like say five to six days mm hmm maybe if you don t if you don t want to go to the gym every day doing the walk on those off days or something like that i try to go to the gym about five days a week and then i do something at home on saturday either i run or i walk um did you ever call about getting the colon screening ?
no i didn t when you give me my my um order this time i m going to okay which place were you going to go ? was it lakeside or downtown ? or pierson clinic ? maybe downtown downtown is just a tad closer but i don t know if they re going to open the back up but downtown is a little closer to me yeah the is a pain where do you live ? i live in downtown detroit off of between and and woodruff oh yeah yeah downtown would be closer than than uh pierson um the bowels still working okay though ?
mm hmm digestion in general okay ? um let s see i had a problem for a while back there but i don t know now i do my um cod liver tablet and just eating the salads in general mm hmm i haven t had as much problem with constipation as i ve had in the past do you eat do you eat quite a few fruits and vegetables in general though ? mm hmm more fruits and vegetables now mm hmm good um do you limit fatty meats ? pretty much i mean retty much ? pretty much just chicken and fish uh huh do you eat a little steak occasionally yeah a very lean steak occasionally is okay and do you with the chicken um do you mostly eat um the light meat without skin ? i like the white meat that s good okay name ? so lower lower fat and the fish is good um a couple of times a week it s good to have fish you said you do eat fish mm hmm you know the some of the fatty fish like salmon tuna uh mackerel those are the ones i like rainbow trout those are pretty high in the good the good oils okay ? those are the ones that i like good um let s see hairline fracture in right hip area many years ago no psych history when we do your blood counts for some reason your red blood cells are big you told me that the last time i checked the b and folic acid they were fine and i ll probably check them again um if they stay the same probably nothing to do if they re getting bigger i might have you see a specialist but um there s nothing really to do you see that sometimes in in people that drink a lot but you don t drink that much uh uh so in your case it may just be the way yours are what kind of problems would it cause if they continue usually uh it won t cause any problem in and of itself it s usually a marker that you either have a liver problem from drinking or low b or low folic acid but none of those seem true in your case and your liver tests your liver enzymes come back okay so it doesn t look like the liver s inflamed how are your knees doing ? because i know those have bothered you off and on
i don t know that s take a little bit of weight off and they re not bothering me as much anymore you know if i sit down for a long period of time i get stiff that does make sense though that building up the muscles you know has supported them better um let s see you re still married
uh huh
um no previous abnormal pap smears and your mother still living ? no she passed last week last week ! just last week ? what uh was this was it kind of expected coming on or ? well you know she had the stroke in uh yeah i did have then she had the brain tumor recent stroke the brain tumor a brain tumor also ? oh i m sorry to hear that um she was she about ? eighty four because she was this last physical um yeah she had a lot of things i guess high blood pressure um diabetes asthma um and i had down that she had a real zest for life she still but still she had that she still had that til the day she left here had that had that with her right until she left huh ? mm hmm
and your father passed at ? no no no he was years old he passed on too that s what i mean yeah that s what i mean oh oh okay yeah passed passed at yeah yeah pneumonia complicated by falls and fractures right ? and kind of a bad facility he was in or something mm hmm didn t help um let s see brother and sister have asthma one sister had breast cancer yeah she passed with oh she passed with that ? cancer mm hmm uh how old was she ? and when was that ? that was back in i m not quite sure ? oh okay i just didn t have down that she had passed mm hmm
uh and then your son s about ? yeah he ll be in february
oh okay so he s still uh so you got tetanus in through the army reserve so you re still covered on that for a while mm hmm and there aren t any other specific uh immunizations that you would need at this point unless you traveled or something like that no they keep still talking about giving us the anthrax oh is that right ? so you re still part of the reserve ?
mm hmm did i put it on right this time ? yeah it s okay
okay um was real good i think maybe slightly more but you know definitely below the bottom one i think was in the s um and that s i guess really the only thing that concerns me let me try this other arm though and see if i hear it any better okay supposed to be down to pretty much it s just down that way because i check it in at least well i used to check it almost once a week but now uh huh i don t i m not that good with it anymore yeah well i m just saying i you know you check it real frequently for a while and then if it seems stable then you don t feel like you need to check it as often okay yeah that was it s really you have a narrow pulse pressure which means not a lot of difference between the top and the bottom like that one i got like um i might have our rn check it too and see what she gets so this was the right and the left so about that about about anywhere from to at the at the highest at the top and the lowest about it is a little challenging when you have that narrow pulse pressure because if you you want this one to be lower but you don t want that one to be lower you know ? so how do you lower one without the other ? you can t really uh i m going to turn out the light for a second to look in the back of your eyes look straight ahead over that way that yours ? there s uh some blood pressure changes in the eyes um we look for narrowing of the small arteries and and pressure from the arteries on the veins and you ve got a little bit of that so that s just another reason to try to make sure we keep it well controlled for your ears
maybe from all the crying what s that ? i said from all the crying oh yeah you mean lately yeah i suppose so so did you just um buried her recently then ? mm hmm mm hmm say ah breathe in and out real deep let me have you lie back on the table what was your mother s name ? if i saw it in the paper no no no she s in south carolina oh so it wasn t around here ? uh uh
heart sounds okay i d be curious to see what the what the ekg shows excuse me cold hands please um because sometimes if you control the pressure well some of the ekg changes can actually improve remember you had the abnormal ekg ? that s why i got concerned and i ve always had those so but it might you mean for a long time ? mm hmm they ve they ve always commented on those ? mm hmm um you know i looked on the cardiologist s note one thing that surprised me was he didn t really change any of the medicines that day he just said he didn t think it was coronary disease just control the pressure mm hmm you know ? but usually they kind of take control and they go ahead and start changing things but it didn t look like he did and i haven t been up to see him since oh pretty much since i started you know since you became my doctor uh huh i did the dr s right ? that s the one i saw it was a couple of years ago i think what is it a nucleus ? whatever nuclear yeah nuclear um nuclear scan scan ? mm hmm
i m checking your pulses down here okay so um i ll get the nurse then and we ll come back or a medical assistant one of them and we ll come back and do your pap and then um then i ll be back after that too come in how are you ? okay uh yeah it s okay if you want okay we ll have you scoot down okay a little bit more i think that s probably good and i ll just be right here right ? yeah that s cold too the last that s what the last lady said this morning yeah some places do don t they ? i think i ve heard some places do that uh this room too because i remember we didn t have a light this morning okay now you ll uh just feel a touch and then the speculum now they the white you want the green ? well we ll see how it works no it s fine yeah that might not have been
is he in college ? mm hmm
okay now i m going to check uh your rectum too and then okay okay you can go ahead and push up now bring your legs together please and go ahead and sit up thank you
okay um if you want you can put your bottoms on but they re going to come back oh sorry and do the ekg and i and i did tell b to have them check your blood pressure the rn okay ? excuse me
are you presentable ? uh just one more second i ll stay behind the curtain okay that s fine
ekg looks you know okay it it does show the abnormalities like before yeah i i had it marked i didn t realize in the computer where we send the prescriptions toprol causes severe fatigue at least at it did uh i don t know would you uh the the i would like to see if we could get the diastolics under here uh would you want to try or do you want to try something from a different class ? well i don t know what you recommend because you know that was causing me to be fatigued and i was kind of really trying to find out when was the best time for me to take that uh huh so i don t know did uh were you ever on amount as or it was only ? well you know when i first started he told me to start with you know but that was way before i got over here uh huh i started with you know half dosage and then work up to the full dosage uh huh so i don t know we can try that and yeah let s let s give it a try and that would probably be enough you probably wouldn t even need more if it if it can be tolerated but if it can t and you know you ll know within a week or two probably if you re going to be able to take it now when do you recommend that me to take that at the same time i take my other you could i mean it s basically a hour medicine can i open the curtain ? so impersonal talking through the curtain uh it s basically a hour medicine but whatever time you choose is fine as long as you re fairly consistent you know so if you well maybe i ll start trying to take it when i take my regular medicine which is in the morning okay yeah it s easier to remember that way and that works mm hmm so we ll we ll try that i ll send maybe i ll just send for the first month and then if it s tolerated we can go with or or whatever and i think i got some at the hospital so i ll look at the prescription and see oh you you want to try to split them then and i won t send any ? and and just well just split them and then you know you re still going to have to send them per say well eventually but maybe you should try those first before okay let me try i send any what i got at the house before before you send any and then let me know in a week or two what what you re going to do okay ? okay just call and leave a message ? yeah and if we can t do that one i may send a real small dose of something else to try and then maybe let s see i think
did you do my um my um the other one ? my to go for the colonoscopy ? oh ! oh no we need to give you that phone number don t we ? well if it s just a matter of me calling i don t need one like i need here ? or is that just a matter of calling ? no you don t you don t need a paper but we need to give you the phone number right ? because you probably oh it s the same as oh no it s not yeah you d need the you d need the because this is for the mammogram i m going to need the phone number she needs the the gi s number downtown she s got the i think okay and low risk screening ? uh yeah low risk that s all i need ? uh huh okay

can you hold your breath ? let it go hold in your breath again let it go take a deep breath once again good once again once again do you check your breasts every month ? do you do a breast exam every month ? yes ma am i m going to lower this and examine the belly and the breast just to be safe
who do you work for ? hmm ? whom do you work for ? the southeastern michigan health association they re from the building oh i see a bunch of accountant and personnel people
yeah and you haven t noticed any problems with your memory or anything ? that s good mm mm a lot better than the past ?

take a deep breath let it go once again any constipation ?
um is it an every day thing ? um i don t i m not regular mm hmm and that s a bad thing um i might be like two days mm hmm maybe as far as three days until i you know go but that s not regular that s not right it s not supposed to be like is um has it always been like that ? i m going to say yes yes now what are the bowel movements that you have are they hard do you have to strain with the bowel movements or are they i think my problem is i don t like to be in the bathroom mm hmm so when i go to the bathroom to do that i make sure that i have to go mm hmm i don t i don t go and sit i don t like to go and sit i like to go and go and get up and then leave so i don t know but i m it depends for example if you tell me that you have a bowel movement every two three days and they re hard and you have to strain then that s constipation but if your bowel movements are regular whenever you go they re soft well formed no blood then then that s probably your normal cycle ohh okay some people go every some people go twice a day some people go three times a day some people go once a day some people go every two days some people don t really oh okay
yeah any swelling in the legs ?
okay alright have a seat besides the besides your ah medications the zocor and your blood pressure pills do you take any calcium ?
no pain right ? anybody in your family has diabetes ? mom dad ?
no that s a good thing so you had your last mammogram in november last year ? i did ? mm hmm last year in and so you ll be due again towards the end of november this year okay thanksgiving ? mm hmm after thanksgiving and um you are actually due for a colonoscopy oh ! we start screening after the age of well we can do that are you okay with that ? i m i m good you need somebody to pick you up and drop you when you have that colonoscopy because it usually what it involves is it s almost a two day thing the night before you have to drink like a gallon of fluid which is like a bowel cleanser mm hmm and the next day ah when you go to the hospital to have it done they um give you sedation while they re doing it because it involves the um they have to the colonoscope is like a thin tube just like a stethoscope it has got a camera at the top and they insert it through the the rectum and go through the whole bowel to check for any polyps so the person giving the sedation okay okay
alright so i m going to get the referral and i m going to get um um all the paper and i ll be back alright but do you need need a urine sample also ? yes uh huh the since yeah the liver yeah the liver is good yeah we ll check a urine sample alright ? but ah for the blood draw you re going to go to the lab which is down the okay okay alright i ll be back mm hmm
come in alright this is the referral for the colonoscopy and this is i need your daytime phone number where they can contact you to make an appointment mm hmm mm hmm alright i m going to fax this to them and this goes home with you this sheet so this is a prescription for the bowel cleanser that we talked about it s called golytely and this sheet explains how to take it um and this yellow pamphlet tells you what is this procedure how do they do it ah if they see polyps they remove the polyps and right there ? mm hmm yeah right there and um it s um but don t get this buy this prescription yet until you have a date and a time alright so this this three four business weeks to give you a call and if they don t call within a month this is the number that you should call the one that i ve circled okay and i ll come here to do it ? no it s done at the main hospital ohh okay so i m going to fax this ah this to them this sheet to them
mm hmm um let me just see if there s any other blood work that s due
are you taking your medications ? none right ? okay so you re taking the once a day ? the water pill ?
you re taking the twice a day ? um you re taking the zocor at bedtime ?
ah the you re taking it still ?
okay the and xanax you take ? oh you don t really it ? i really i needed it when they prescribed it but i didn t like it why what happened ? when i took the i cut the pill in half because i was i didn t know so i cut it in half and the first time i took it mm hmm it made me get a migraine and i said eu i don t like that so i said you know what i m going to leave it alone so i don t take it anymore alright do you feel you need something though ? sometimes i think i do mm hmm but i m scared about what it s called ? yeah i m scared of that um yeah sometimes sometimes i get nervous um and i think i do need something mm hmm but that scares me when i got the migraine the headache ? yeah yeah
and are you taking the ? yeah for the reflux yeah how frequently do you take that ? um i try not to take it often uh huh it might be um like two or three times a week mm hmm um because if i eat correctly mm hmm it ll be fine you know but when i m when i m bad it shows yeah yeah so i know what i m supposed to do and i m trying going to do it
you have lost weight haven t you ? yes i have yeah you have lost um nine pounds more ? this is compared to last year oh last year ? mm hmm last year when i was when i saw who ? when i saw you ? ah this is i m looking at mz that was last yeah that was last year in december
so that s good so when you say some ah situations make you nervous which ones are we talking about ? this is life um i have two teenage daughters uh huh um the one she thinks she s mother and i get frustrated frustrated by her so normally i don t even talk i mean i just i just don t say nothing to her because she thinks she s the boss and she thinks she s the boss of me and you know she knows everything and i m stupid i m stupid so i m going to say it s just ah it s just her that makes me nervous um most times i m good yes i m good most times so that s that s good i don t really know if i really need something yeah i mean the thing is i would say no if sometimes it s more counseling that works than than pills right so i m thinking a couple deep breaths and step back and you know i ll i be alright that s what i m saying you know that s what i think you know i think most of the teenagers go through the phase where they think that they know more than anybody else that doesn t mean that you are stupid or you re dumb or oh shoot oh girl please but i he gave me these ah zi zi zocor ? mm hmm when i had a car accident i was really nervous then you mean xanax ? xanax yeah the xanax that s when ah dr s gave it to you gave it to me because i was really nervous i was jumpy and it was like oh my god so um but i i didn t like how it made me feel with the migraine mm hmm mm hmm and i said you know that s fine i mean if it s not suiting you we stop the medication yeah i don t take it i don t like it now if i get nervous again and i need it i might half to cut it in half again no give me a call okay i will we could we can prescribe you something else and not the same one if that one is causing you side effects we can give you something else but if you think if you re doing okay as i said you know we say that pills don t teach you life coping skills and sometimes it s the counseling that helps oh yeah right sometimes both together help right cool mm hmm
alright but ah the other thing that i wanted to start is ah calcium with vitamin d um any over the counter would be fine this and this it comes in store brands also rite aid cvs have their own store brands the other brands like caltrate are more expensive but you just need approximately ah milligrams of calcium and um i.u of vitamin d in each tablet that s a day so this is just to make sure your bones don t get thinner because you know once menopause hits the bones start getting thinner since there s no estrogen around right right
so um that and exercise those two things too and i m not asking you to go and try to you know lift pounds run a marathon ! yeah yeah so we re trying to see for example you could be walking right right it could be dancing or doing what you like to do um for example you could decide to walk i would say start slow start small and go slow maybe minutes for a week first till you get used to it and then increase it to half an hour so that would help you know the the pill to to exercise hasn t changed yet that s true that s true
alright so this for your blood work and your urine work it s done down the hallway if you go into the main lobby just right down you ll see two water fountains ? mm hmm next to it is the lab and ah they re going to check your fasting blood sugar also and oh that s the they re going to check your potassium and all of that because your potassium was slightly low on the last blood work the one that it s a bit low but that can help you because of your water pill oh okay so we ll check all of that okay so i take this to the lab ? mm hmm um okay
and for the colonoscopy they will get in touch with you within a month okay okay thank you very much
nice meeting you it s nice talking to you we should meet in another ah four months just to check your blood pressure okay i ll make an appointment alright ? okay take care thank you very muc
hi it s me how are you ? in my panic mode
he s used to it you re agreed to have emily here for the discussion ?
i ve got my questions my notes my blood pressure from last night was the last one cause i don t want you to take it cause you ll tell me i m having a stroke and your pulse rate that s good to see yeah but don t take it right now and uh just let me review did you bring in your blood pressure cuff at all ? no uh uh we checked it last time and it seemed to correlate didn t it ? yeah this is i take about mm every three weeks to a month if i take it all the time then i freak out so its better if i don t um focus on it and you sit for a few minutes and and i need a new prescription for that s kind of why i came in cause they wouldn t refill it until i saw you right okay
and dr k was okay you know who he is ? he retired yes yes so i have been on the now it ll be seven years in september right honey ? mm hmm yeah okay right yeah cause is when i had my uh right goodness and um he put me on the mm hmm last year but he wants me to go off it so my question to you is at at last year he did how do you wean off of it ? i m still taking it every day cause i wasn t sure mm hmm i mean you probably think too i should go off it right ? in general yes in general um cause he originally said about five years mm hmm after the mm hmm mm hmm ovaries to stay on it but it s been seven he did lower the dosage yeah and then i think he put you back up but then we didn t oh you never did he was gonna put me back up but then didn t we stayed on a three yeah yeah and you re first of all you re comfortable on the ? yeah and i think that you had tried off of it didn t you ? and you had some postmenopausal symptoms ? yeah well yeah i was afraid to go down to the three cause i was having some symptoms but then i did and it s been fine is there one even lower ? you know not really not really what we usually do and you can do it any way you want you know some people start going every other day um maybe do that for a couple weeks and some people and then you can start going three days three days kinda see how you feel over a couple weeks you know you can even do it a month or a couple weeks something like that and um uh so you slowly yeah some people just go off cold turkey and are fine other people get symptoms so why not uh go more gradually maybe every other day ? something like that try that for a few weeks and ? yeah for two to four weeks something like that see how you are and then maybe then go to every three days or twice a week do you know what i mean ? maybe monday s and thursday s or sunday s and wednesday s or something like that ? see how you do get one of them little pill we get them little pill things do it that way so there s no you know there s no hard and fast way to do it and you don t have to do it that way it s just yeah i d probably feel more comfortable doing it that way yeah yeah
and kinda see how it goes okay so any other questions ? oh yeah um i have never had a bone density test mm hmm is that something you think i should get ? good question and again just to review your your um yeah your your ovaries were removed in as you mentioned mm hmm you had the a total hysta and so you would have been that s seven years ago right ? so you were you ve been on estrogen yeah prom i didn t that s okay that s the brand name for estrogen oh okay you know in general um that s protected me ? it it should have protected you and you know the world health organization says do um a bone mineral density at age oh okay i wasn t sure there is concern that that might be on the later side for some people you know since you re still on estrogen and you re not frail and thin i would tend i would tend to think your bone density is good oh okay now that s a guess and there are people who are not good you know not as good as we think so you know you i would tend to i would tend to wait okay i watch you know you watch all those commercials i know if you if you strongly wanted one now i d have very low threshold for ordering it i would tend to wait but i would push calcium and vitamin d which i think i wrote down for you before and i ll ask you if you re taking that in a well are you taking that ? can you get that all in like one vitamin like a one a day kind of thing ? not exactly oh okay let me get your questions and then i m gonna review that with you
um blood work do i need blood work ? i haven t had it in couple that s a good question yes and i hope you didn t eat ? i did not eat now that s another thing just to keep our eye on because once you go off your cholesterol profile may change oh really ? estrogen tends to lower the bad cholesterol it actually has a really nice effect on cholesterol that s interesting i didn t know that you know once you re off that we ll pay even more attention to it although so um yes you are to it s been a couple years i think that was the main thing yeah you definitely need that today okay ?
um do i need a pap test ? you know it s really interesting he said what did he say ? well he used to do it i think he was more concerned because at the time that i had the ovaries out they weren t sure if it was cancer so i think that s kind of why cause he you know suggested i see him but then he you know he said you could go to someone else and i think he just kind of did it uh because then you know he said really when you have everything out there s really nothing to check for and if you re not having problems which i m not right you didn t have cancer i did not have and i m glad to hear you you know he s a gynecologist so like you know you go there like he s kind of gonna do it right cause that s kind of his whole thing but the truth is yes i don t think you really need it every year and what what are we looking for now ? vaginal cancer ? i mean that is so rare and you know when i try to pin down gynecologists and a patient s had no cancer basically they might say yeah every three to five years and maybe you know so i think we can wait a few years for that unless you strongly wanted it then i would no well he just did it last september yeah he did it actually yeah of i think here i have his note actually it might have been yeah february of so i don t feel strongly about it why don t i just wait okay ?
and my if you could check my ears mm hmm i know i have allergies and um i have a ringing in my left ear that s so i don t know if i have wax in there or if it could be from allergies or how long have you had that ? well it seems like it s just been bothering me in the last couple weeks that i really like it s really noticeable continuously or ? on and off ? okay so your left ear is ringing ? um and there s no pain and you can hear alright ? i think so maybe i should have my hearing tested
well that s it s a yeah it s a question go ahead anything else ? uh no i think that s all my so let me ask you go ahead
i need a prescription for my mammogram i get it every july absolutely that is definite mammogram and then while we re on this um okay here we go now we talked about colonoscopy ? i know i don t want to have it you ve never had it i know he has it you know it ac can t i just do that poopy thing ? your stool cards are better than nothing but um you know i actually had a colonoscopy so you know your husband can tell you the experience now i can also tell you and everybody says the worst part is prep right mr r ? mm hmm plus my son has he has has to get them all the time you know what ? it s the whole thing is like nothing other than it s the i know prep which you drink this
i guess it s not that i m afraid of that but it s just how i get these stupid panic attacks whenever i m in a hospital right right which is just wrong
the nice thing is they sedate you i know and you don t even know from adam while you re there i know i mean really it s such a simple thing right ? mr r ?
her blood pressure will go up ? yeah they want to do it cause she s gonna get sedated yeah i don t like to be sedated it s the sedation she doesn t like i don t think it s the tests it s the sedation really ? yeah i know i mean you could yeah she s anti drug
yeah i mean you know what ? you don t have to have sedation but most people don t recommend that you what yeah you can have no sedation it s just um less comfortable yeah i mean we could just give you a little oral valium but you know i would get the sedation cause i don t want to feel that yeah yeah yeah yeah so really you should have a colonoscopy i don t want to stress you but it really you know plus the drugs these days are really good you know they do find things hey do find things sometimes what i mean is but most people don t ave almost no recovery period i know honey it s not even that it s not even the sedation i m afraid of you know i just i get myself worked up mm hmm i i wish i didn t i understand believe me right right really and truly the whole thing it s a non event it s a non event is right you just have to drink that stuff the night before and um you know what my insurance gave it us with no flavoring and so i just on my own i put in some lime crystal light like to each i got like a little pour it each time and make it up and and the pharmacist said really that was a great idea because i wouldn t drink that stuff with no flavoring i we can use the so anyway um can i refer you ? or are we not there yet ? can it wait six months ? you know absolutely in fact um what i ll do is why don t i put through the referral and then what they do is they call you and over the phone they clear you and and and then once you re cleared you can say you know what ? i don t want to do it till july or when ever you want to do it okay ? so let s definitely cause there s days that i m like okay you know okay so i m gonna refer you for that
she s got lots of notes
freaky year old lady yeah right with panic disorder
so let me ask you a few other things um you re not a smoker i know and and are not any more you drinking any alcohol ? nope i do not drink alcohol not at all ? i should but

and we re on weight watchers i had gone up and then lost again but we re back on our great that would be great cause yeah is paying for it it s been working out really good that is great cause as you know for blood pressure lose weight yeah and just in general to have a healthy bmi your body mass index for for height of you d want to be another pounds one thirty eight maybe pounds i got a ways to go ou ve heard that we re doing it okay alright and then the biggest change in our lifestyle in a long time weight watchers ? yeah cause we eat in terms of that s great uh points now that s great even when we break things we know we re doing it yeah least then you can maybe make up later
so let me review is your mom still alive ? yes she is so she must be what eighty eighty five five ? mm hmm and she had had breast cancer mm hmm anything else ? does she have any other medical issues ? she has uh hypertension she does have okay ? and she has sugar that s controlled by diet now and that s about it hard of hearing oh yeah she s deaf hard of hearing in both of her ears

okay alrighty and then so are you on any multi vit at all ? i think i wrote this down for you before i need to get one yeah you did let me you know cause write it again yeah so what it is is you re supposed to be on vitamin d to units a day and then calcium meaning elemental calcium mm hmm is like mg a day now do you drink any milk or have dairy ? i have dairy but i don t drink milk cause i m lactose intolerant but i eat cheese and yogurt yeah yogurt and cheese are good for calcium they don t have vitamin d supplement you know the way to do the vitamin d is now what i did is i just went to drugstores and got they were tablets with it said units of vitamin d mm hmm and you can purchase that or there s like a women s i think it s called a women s multi vit that has of d right in it oh okay you could do that or if you want really tiny things what i did initially was just go to drugstore and get generic tiny multi vit s you know i got a jar that said in the jar small jar i thought these gotta be little these have to be little and then each of those have of these so i just took a day oh okay so if you want them really tiny you can just take two of those a day or get a you know get a jar of like units mm hmm per and just vitamin d alone and take that mm hmm daily so that would cure the vitamin d um okay and then the calcium supplement ? yeah calcium supplement some people do caltrate d or oscal d what i think is kinda fun are the calcium chews ? those chews i saw those at costco yeah they have caramel and chocolate and you can either take one twice a day or one a day plus your two portions of dairy okay ? so i m gonna just write here calcium chew or caltrate d like at least once per day and then plus your dairy okay ? okay mm hmm and then the vitamin d just really get that cause that s such an easy thing to do and that s good for ? your bones this is to try to prevent osteoporosis osteoporosis yeah and so many of us like most of the men and women in our right here are vitamin d deficient cause you have to be in the sun minutes a day to get vitamin d conversion in your skin and we tell people don t go out in the sun in the sun yeah so then the other days there isn t sun so yeah especially in michigan i drink a gallon of milk you d i drink a gallon of milk uh half percent milk so a gallon so that a gallon i think is it cup cups times quarts is cups so you re getting maybe cups of milk a day uh huh a little more than that so each cup of milk has mg of calcium so you re getting mg of calcium does he need more ? there s a little bit of vitamin d in the milk um plus i take a one a day so then you get more he takes the men s you probably do reasonably well you know some people do that and their vitamin d levels are great and other people their vitamin d levels aren t so good but you re probably better
than most okay so i m gonna go ahead and examine you
um any and we know your tetanus shot was right ? that s why i didn t quote me on that one bug you on that one
okay alright ? i ll wait outside okay thank you
okay so i m going to go ahead and examine you um just in case they come in or try to come in or right i didn t know you re you re gonna stay in for the exam ? i ll be i ll be in the room with give us a little bit of uh privacy here alrighty and then did you want me to take it off ? i wasn t sure see ? i told you she said your underwear leave your underwear on
okay nobody ever gets it straight did you say you need the as well ? you need me to prescribe that ? um you know what i don t think so i think i have enough refills on it otherwise i could always call
sure thank you again breathe normal and swallow please alright we re going to go ahead and lie down you know let me just hold this down oh okay
and just so you know usually we like to get blood work once a year cause you re on the diuretic and you ve been doing a physical once a year is probably a great idea
so that d be great are you doing self breast exams ? mm hmm yeah i m pretty good about that since my mom had the cancer right big breath okay alright okay that s great alrighty go ahead and sit up please and cover your top and then um can i get you to slip off the socks for a minute ? mm hmm
thank you are you knitting that ? it s so pretty i m crocheting it s a calming thing too yeah isn t that nice
right so every time you do weight bearing walking or mm hmm you know weight and exercise that helps your bones that s great okay
and look at these two little varicose veins stockings ? do you have uh you have compression stockings ? you know sometimes they even hurt yeah if you were seeing a vascular surgeon they d probably tell you to go on them um some people just get supportive hose but you know the prescription kind are really my mom wears them but actually the to mm ones i think are not by prescription and you can actually just go to a medical supply place and get some they either have like either thigh high or panty hose you know ? like you have some up here yeah these ones just started down here i think the to mm which are really taut are prescription insurance doesn t always cover it and what they pay um i think if i were try with just the ones you can buy ? i think i would consider the to mm see how comfortable you are now they re not real cheap yeah my mom gets them let me write that down yeah to mm would be maybe a starter one um and you d need either thigh high or panty hose and you could go to health core or any medical supply place do you know where that is or should we give you a list ? no my um nephew actually works for one of those companies so you know right so i think this does not require a prescription okay i can call k and ask him it s health care something health core s great so let me make a note you have some varicosities and the right is worse than the left isn t it ? mm hmm thigh as well okay getting old sucks well elevate the legs lose weight and some of its just genetic as you mentioned mm hmm okay let me go ahead and um ? oh yeah are you getting seven o clock in the morning i used to take it before i went to work i take both pills that he gives me before he leaves for work if i m not up he s so sweet mm hmm and he takes his our little team medical uh it s easy to forget that
yeah no i never do cause i always worry about you know and i do the salt solution in my nose uh huh yeah your ear looks great there s no wax or anything oh good can you hear this ? mm hmm if you ve ever had any ringing though what we usually do is um can you hear this as well as over here mm hmm same usually what we ll do if you want mm hmm or probably it s a good idea you ve had continuous ringing is to seen by an ear nose and throat and audiology and have a hearing test and have your ear nose and throat a physician mm hmm
evaluate that do you um do you feel like you ve had a cold or nasal stuffiness or anything ? just kind of nasal yeah kind of like the allergy kind for how long ? kind of stuff for how long ? it s just always off and on um i saw dr gardner when did i see dr gardner the ear nose and throat guy t ? a few years ago i went for the same symptoms ? for um actually i had a um sore in my nose and he he uh is the one that told me to use the salt water mm g ? for sinuses ? yeah g g mm hmm so i kind of do that but you didn t he didn t give you but he i didn t have my ears tested or anything and that was cause of a sore in the nose ? yeah but it was you know he knew that i kind of had had allergies but i can t take any of that allergy stuff cause i get the you know he told me don t take right right antihistamines and stuff like that he was trying to tell me more natural ways to do it is your nose chronically stuffed or dripping ? not chronically just on and off ? yes on and off some people use a steroid nasal spray i don t know if you ve ever done that like he uses that every day mm hmm can open the nose and might help decongest if that s an issue but maybe see the ear nose and throat
if you re if you re if you re really having yeah to ringing so i m gonna give you the number to a ear nose and throat and audiology for that do they have one at ? they do for sure for sure ?
for sure and i m gonna recheck your blood pressure can i get you to sit here ? and then what we can do is just put this down so that you have some protection from that public chair okay alright now you re all calm and relaxed plus your readings at home are really quite good they have been good and they ve been better and better since i ve lost some weight too so i know if i keep going that s good and can get it down to more stable that s very good little more panicky i just wish there was a way that i didn t do that to myself but well sounds like you re managing rather well in terms of losing weight and being active mm hmm active i am how long has it been since you brought in your cuff ? last last i don t know if i brought it in last time i think last time was before maybe it was the time before ?
they do have a lab here ? for the blood work ? we do oh okay yeah we do have to go
we have a lab yep we have screening mammography um an be done here or at
before that ? six and then i saw you in regarding some issues don t even tell me what it is sorry ? don t even tell me what it is cause then i get myself worked up and think oh my god you know what i mean ? one thing that i want to do is just yeah yeah okay okay once more then we re gonna just leave it be okay good right exactly can t sit and worry about it right right it s weird how you can make it spike or
right you can come down some when you re ready i m gonna let you get dressed i m gonna just check a couple little things and then i ll be back in to summarize okay ? alright thank you and then you re gonna leave me with this nice card right ? thank you okay
we re doing a survey okay so i just wanted to clarify um give you the number to ear nose and throat and audiology and that s at so uh it s under ent so when you call there you know so ask for you say you need a hearing test as well cause you have ringing oh okay you need like you know audiology and ent
okay ? so that s that and my assistant will um give you the other papers in a few minutes you know just for the blood work ? for the blood work the mammogram and uh she ll refer she ll fax a colonoscopy request
okay and the prescription ? yeah should i call that into your pharmacy which is cvs on michigan ? because sometimes it s supposed to be on the computer and then they tell me it s not on there so i didn t know if you wanted to write one out or no i ll just we do it by computer and michigan to the michigan avenue one right ? michigan avenue correct right and then again your yeah your heart rates and blood pressures do look good here i looked it up you did bring in your cuff in it didn t correlate exactly but mm hmm they were both elevated here and mm hmm it s been good at home again as i mentioned um even though this looks really perfectly satisfactory if they re accurate um again we can just leave you on the mm hmm as mentioned before i have a low threshold adding a little bit of beta blocker mm hmm kinda low which tends to lower the heart rate in a normal person but again if these are true readings that s what i m getting when i sit down and relax and if this is an accurate cuff then this is perfectly fine okay well let s y this and see if it works let me do this and then just continue the weight loss will really help yeah yup okay ? and exercise okay so next time i see you you know if it s just for a physical in a year that s fine maybe bring in your cuff and we ll just we ll just recheck correlate them again okay great okay ?

oh hell no how many hours a night do i get ? maybe about mm hm it s like i finally and i don t even go to sleep in my bed i sit in my recliner and then when i feel like i m getting drowsy i push it back i set the tv to shut off in about minutes and and go to sleep but i no i i don t sleep well mm hm even on weekends when i could sleep well i m up and doing but i m not doing anything i m just up mm hm how s your appetite ? well too much evidently well i don t know that the getting the right kinds mm hm how did you with the holidays ? um i was distracted the week before christmas i had mm hm and so they keep you occupied it s a handful yeah the week after christmas i went to my months after i did mm hm and so we just kind of visited together a little bit mm hm so they came and went but did i decorate ? no i just didn t want to decorate did i send cards ? no mm hm and i thought i would ve been ready to do that because was a year mm hm because you just don t want to do stuff mm hm is that changing ? not yet not yet would you be interested in seeing a counselor ? i have seen through work we have a counseling program mm hm where shortly after t s death i went to them and they tended to think i was pretty normal par for the course mm hm so i stopped i don t know if i need to see anyone i m and discussing what my husband was like mm hm i don t know if if seeing someone would be beneficial for me personally mm hm would you be interested in taking a medication ? would a medication do anything ? would it make it better ? um obviously it s not going to change the process and things that things are never going to you know they re never going to be the same i know that yeah but at the same time you know you re still avoiding things you re not doing things it sounds like and and you know there s no right or otherwise they ll take my house away from me i don t have a choice otherwise your sons would have you know but you energy and more more ambition i guess that s yeah i think that s what i would like to now i ve had someone to cut my grass mm hm and he also has a plow and a x so in the winter yesterday he s moving oh really and i m panicking because i have and so i looked at drive or my sidewalk and i know i have to mm hm especially when he moves so yeah you know so again it s going to how it helping that process along i would love something to help it along because i m would happen to me ? mm hm yeah so through all of this any thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself ? thankfully no no i have a faith stronger than that i keep thinking i could picture my husband saying what the hell are you doing down there c um well do you have a preference between using a medication or seeing a counselor or ? i m not i ve never been comfortable talking about real make one or two sessions and then not continue so so you might prefer to go with the medication ? yeah let s see what happens okay yeah and and what we would use would be an would be is citalopram i have no clue i understand it s a once a day medication the main side effect is it can make you drowsy is it better to take morning or evening or does it matter ? i would say to take it in the evening because that way if little while before you would see the benefit from that
two other well one other question she said my blood pressure was real high yeah yeah i don t know part of the not doing things is like you mm hm and thinking i don t really know so should i take it can blood pressure medication be taken at night ? yeah the one you re taking absolutely okay because someone told me oh no no you have to take them on the morning there s some that it matters more than others but with yours you re fine doing that
okay so if i did i would be more likely to take it prescription and did some counting did the math and i m going oh i missed it quite a bit lately mm hm which might explain that and the other thing you can do is getting like you per day yeah but that still means opening it in the morning and taking it where i would sooner do it at night than in the morning right although but that way you ll know you had it started to mention ?
i can t remember see that s the other thing i don t remember
you ve been feeling okay otherwise in terms of any chest pain shortness of breath ? that s the shortness of breath i have been having taking the blood pressure medication ? it may also be more related to the fact that you re not doing as much this is a bad time to get out and start doing anything though other than that so the blood pressure you re usually taking any other medications you re taking regularly ? the only thing i have cats and i will not get rid of them assuming it s a mild allergy to my cats ah ha and so if i like right now i feel congested if i were benadryl the little pink pill yeah diphenhydramine yeah that thing i ll take one of those usually i take congested through the night and they ll tend to make you drowsy yeah they don t help me sleep though
okay anything else you re taking regularly ? if my knee is bothering me from arthritis something like one but no other than that nothing
antacids laxatives anything like that ? oh god no
don t smoke ? any alcohol ? once in a while a glass of wine at night something like that but not a lot
any exercise ? that s no see that i was doing before now i m not and that s something that i would really encourage you ton of the energy i never did a big workout but i would after work i supper and stuff now i get home and right and you know but i think that s the trap people bike or a treadmill or ? i don t but my sons would be more than happy to that they know is good well you know whatever works walk after work i can take the stairs at work which i don t
so whatever works for you convenience wise is is that
blood pressure medication yeah it ll last a few more days but i haven t
and i have noticed with the change in prescriptions and want to see ? that s no you re fine just look straight ahead open okay follow my finger with your eyes okay i m going to assume that you ve already eaten today ? no i have not eaten supper i ate lunch no i came clothes i could not come in pantyhose
okay breathe normally check that blood pressure just relax your arm come down over that s still not good still a little bit on the high side yes gee i usually don t have white count syndrome that s because my blood pressure has been too high has it ? well that was a bad sign you should ve been coming i know ?
no that s fine just breathe normally okay are you doing breast exams ? found anything that concerned you ? that s a good ahead and bump that up a step
and we ll get the blood pressure under control and work okay but we ll worry about that once we he used to kill me t t would come in here after over mm hm and i would look at him because mine would always be the or something like that and yet he s the one with all of the with all of the problems and whatever but once they amputated the leg mm hm he no longer had to take blood pressure medication mm hm so all i think of is part of the that extra push was part of the problem it s it s you know it s complicated and you know
however not taking blood pressure medication didn t keep him alive mm hm
mm hm so and so i will send that prescription for either or both either or both
depending on how that works out i will go ahead and mammogram
okay when will they ever learn i mean when will they find one that doesn t hurt ? you re asking the wrong person i know you can t even relate to it when you go for the mammogram you can ask them maybe they can help you with that but anyways you re also due i think we talked about a couple of years back about doing a colonoscopy and never got done mm hm so are you interested in the i m not i have i have a hemorrhoid that well let s can start to bleed mm hm but it stops quickly and whatever and so i just i d we ll come back to that at another time okay we ll argue about it another day
fair enough okay so you can go ahead and get dressed and i will send those prescriptions right to the and we ll see you back next month
hello there sir ! how are you ? fine thank you
good you know that she was coming in ? okay alright she s been here a long time before you
yes i know i was talking to her earlier today so how have you been ? been behaving ? oh somewhat somewhat ? taking care of yourself doing the right things ? mm hmm
eating right exercising all that good stuff ? oh absolutely alright keeping your weight down ?
and you don t smoke right ? that s right
my hdl is actually yeah isn t that something ? you finally got it up there
that s fantastic your whole profile looks great there it is on a spreadsheet with the latest on the top row there you never smoked or you quit a long time ago ? i never have had a cigarette in my life
good for you alright fantastic so you ve got your ldl where the cardiologist wants you to have it which is lower than or lower that s where they want it so you re doing great there how did you get that hdl up there ? you been exercising regularly is that what you did ? um i could say yes but i d be somewhat lying well how did you do that ? uh actually i ve been i mentioned before i ve been seeing a holistic doctor who has given me some supplements and um that is supposed to help out with blood readings and since it s um all natural it doesn t have any of the side effects of the medications interesting okay so i have been keeping active i have been doing some exercise walk the dogs several miles several times a day or several times a week i mean okay and you re still taking lipitor ?
okay alright well your liver enzymes came down a little bit that s good that s good i saw the consult that you had with the gastroneurology there so they don t think you need a liver biopsy mm hmm so that s good news liver enzyme came down a little bit there as i told you already okay the alpha fetoprotein test that they did that was normal as well your psa is also normal so that s good and your kidney function is stable those are the four parameters that we look at when it comes to kidney function so everything looks good on your lab work very very good oh yeah the uh the physician s assistant i saw over at gastroenterology she added a couple of tests to the ones you already had assigned yeah alpha fetoprotein and alpha trypsin anti trypsin or something yeah and then some iron studies were put in there too and they all look good so you re doing great
uh the fecal blood test i dropped that off this morning or today when i walked in here you did okay they probably don t have it done yet yeah i doubt if they have that it s probably in progress as they call it let me see yeah it s not even been put up there yet a whole minutes now
what s wrong with them right ? okay any questions about your labs ?
alright you got pain in the left knee ? why do you think you might have a torn cartilage ? uh around the end of june we had the windstorm that took down a bunch of trees we ve got acres of land we lost about trees and i was just doing well a bunch of chainsaw cutting and all of a sudden you know a day later i noticed my knee was hurting whenever i would bend it severely back it would hurt when i kneeled down on it it would hurt and i ve kind of been avoiding kneeling on it until yesterday and i realize it still hurts the problem the pain is going away um i don t think for awhile there i was thinking well i definitely need to look into something but uh as i was saying the pain is pretty minimal alright did you have any swelling in the knee ? are you limping ? no even that doesn t hurt right now okay no limping huh ? the only time it hurts now is when i kneel on it alright but you can walk you can keep your exercise routine ? yeah yes okay well here s the deal let s say you have a torn cartilage mm hmm they re not going to do anything about it i can tell you right now i ve sent so many people over there with mris that show torn cartilage the first thing they do is physical therapy and if everything resolves they don t do anything mm hmm so if you didn t have a lot of swelling you re not limping and you re able to be active it s not worth getting the mri really cause it shows the torn cartilage and so what ? they re going to say mm hmm you know ? but if you had pain and if you had limping and you had a lot of swelling when it happened mm hmm then there might be a major tear in there mm hmm but now that the pain is gone and you re feeling better it s not worth it that s that s my take on that based on all the people i ve sent over there cause i get those consult notes back and i said now why didn t they do surgery on that one ? i know you know and i see the picture and but that s their reasoning mm hmm
if they re not going to help you with the procedure they re not going to do it okay now you re interested in a stress test why ? mm hmm it s been awhile just to have one alright when you walk are you walking at a aerobic pace or just really leisurely kind of here we go i m trucking along trucking along ? do you know what your heart rate is ? are you on a beta blocker ? uh yeah atenolol kay then it s not uh yeah so it s not going to go up then you wouldn t know but when you re walking at this pace you don t get chest pain ? nope not at all uh something recently that has come up for me uh i was interested in this um stress test anyways and i have had five stents the last one i can t remember exactly when it was but it was during when ronald reagan s funeral was on i was in the hospital recovering and all that s going on is his funeral for days on end uh but um i am now i work for chrysler they are going probably going to be offering me a retirement package to be out of work by the end of november so i m kind of looking for a full tune up before i leave okay alright but no chest pains nothing okay i was just kind of thinking in my situation i think it s somewhat routine if that such thing as you re seeing a cardiologist on a regular basis ? no ? were you you were seeing one i haven t seen doc aren t you ? um is it dr or um yeah was the one i think you were seeing yes and i haven t seen her in seven eight years okay was she doing a yearly stress test on you when she saw you ? nope nope she was not okay okay since you had any conversation it s been longer than that i think since the stress or is that the stress test ? what is what the stress test ? been four years ago this was a visit with her just to talk is now having some symptoms suggestive of angina he had an exercise stress test awhile ago which was not abnormal i think he s going to need a stress test imaging modality see but that s because you re saying you got symptoms so i would have done that too mm hmm so then it looks like you went in you had that done yeah and then follow that up with uh the stent okay so that s when that s when you had stents back then ? yes that was the last one alright so summary the other four were done in uh eight years ago okay are you having any shortness of breath or nausea ? i m not having any symptoms none whatsoever mm hmm okay at work i do a lot of walking on the stairs and the escalators and um since that one four and a half years ago when i was getting chest pain i ve been very conscious of it i do get winded on the stairs and on the walking escalator but i have no discomfort okay well i got a little difference between this ekg and the other one just a little bit there you got a little skipping beat there have you noticed your heart to be skipping ? where are we ? there here it is see how nice and regular that is mm hmm here you go little skip right there the good thing is that it s not sustained it s not like you re getting one every other beat you re not having a run of them and then back to normal a run of them then back to normal that would be a little more serious but you got a little skip there you can see it here okay a loose wire ? not necessarily sometimes well i guess you could put in those terms of a loose wire but the conduction system as we get older starts to go a little bit off in some people and considering that you ve had some damage in the past that s not surprising well let s go ahead and do the stress test just based on this let s do that a stress echo on the um since i ve got everything else scheduled i might as well go all out which location ? what are my choices ? we have west bloomfield fairlane sterling heights sterling heights sterling heights it is alright what phone number do you want them to call you at ? um let me give you my cell phone
alright very good did you get your flu shot ? yes got it at work it s already done got it at work okay alright let's see so we got that that that that alright you got a colonoscopy coming up already right ? mm hmm so that s taken care of you ve been after me for three years on that one now i have ? mm hmm you ve been avoiding it ?
and then the cat scan of my liver you had one or you re having one ? i m having it i ve been scheduled for this thursday
right okay do you need any refills on any medicines ? okay oh yes you marked them let me go back there cause i saw that you marked them here they are the atenolol and the lipitor
yeah and the two other boxes that are sitting up there on top oh these two ? you use these periodically or all the time ? uh periodically okay where s the rash ? um on my shin the shin area ? it flares up once a year or so usually in fall and winter that s the time and the other one is for athlete s foot that dr gave me years ago and that one flares up once a year which happened to be about a few weeks ago alright let s see
the lipitor and the atenolol i m doing mail order on that i d appreciate a um a three month prescription see what she put in there lipitor she put in there and renewable indefinitely she s got you a full year s supply there alright okay and then you re taking the zoloft one and a half tablets by mouth once a day ? yeah but the shrink is issuing that one okay not me so we don t need to do this one then that s right
delete that one and then the atenolol milligrams one tablet by mouth once a day alright alright lipitor is milligrams ? lipitor milligrams okay i ve come down from so i guess that s doing okay that is good that is good twice a day this is the cream you have not the lotion right ? i don t know what the expiration date is but after years it s still working that s good lucinonide lucinonide or maybe you have something else in your bag of tricks if this works i would stick with what works lucinonide there it is and you ve got what strengths ? and this is the cream gel ? would it be easier if i brought the boxes ? absolutely okay now is this something you get this tube last you a long time ? you didn t have to get it you know refilled ? no didn t need any refills i think it s been at least a couple years
alright okay and all these are going where ? uh the lipitor and atenolol i d like a printed copy i ll mail it in okay lipitor and the other the other two will be going to the uh local cvs pharmacy okay so let me print this print without sending the atenolol and lipitor there you go alright and then these are going to the local pharmacy which is cvs over on north adams road in oakland township ? yes it is
yeah send it over there alright that s done okay now the atenolol okay i my blood pressure was a little bit up when i walked in mm hmm i m assuming it s down by now um assuming i m retired at the end of november i would like to consider you know reducing you know since i m away from stress a little bit i d like to consider reducing that at some point in time sure we can do that is uh milligrams much of a dosage of atenolol ? ahhh you can do it even lower than that some people take even half that it all depends in your case though i don t know that you re going to are you thinking about getting rid of it completely ? not necess not right away okay but eventually ? not a good idea okay that s the only thing i would say there because of your history you know beta blockers have a protective effect on the heart not just blood pressure so that s the only reason why i i m in no rush to stop i just want to reduce it if need be cause there s side effects to every medication oh sure no i agree with you i agree with you but let s let s see what happens then once you get off the stress mm hmm

right now do you know how many cancers are there in the world ? no ? quite a few quite a few yeah thousands of them mm hmm so many cancer of the skin cancer of the throat pancreas stomach lungs all sorts of cancers right ? and the stories which you hear about cancer is oh god when i found it it had already spread very early stage so we can cure it cancers aren t curable always right ? most of them right so there are only three cancers cervical i ve heard of that one um breast yeah the mammogram that i had and i take it and the third one is ? colon cancer colon the colon i haven t done that either actually out of these three cancers mm hmm cervical and breast colon cancer has a hundred percent cure rate if we just find it early mm hmm the only cancer i know in the world which if you find very early is completely curable colon colon colon cancer so the idea is to find it early so that you can cure it right ? and that s what you do pap smears for that s what you do mammograms for and that s what you do colonoscopy for the three things that i have been really not taking the time to come in and do alright they re beating me down okay no it s your choice i know i know i m just giving you the figures now so ah mammogram is very simple to do and so is pap smear right ? yeah i ve done a million through the years you ve done a million before but not the mammogram i have not mammogram is simple to do it s a little painful but it s it s just an x ray so that is not a big deal most of the time people don t want to do all these things because they re scared
you know i m going to be honest with you there s a you guys are getting me past the fear cause i m feeling really childish and stupid by not going forward but the saturday appointments are just so wonderful it s that break in your day running in here things are just maddening at this hospital you know ? i know i know so more sat i if i can do more on a saturday i would get in more right unfortunately like i hurried dermatology this morning internal medicine you know it s just so much more convenient
i think they do i think they do mammograms one saturday on saturday if i m not mistaken okay if you think so and paps smears definitely because you know you can always come here i can do it or you can go to ob gyn and they can do it well this is my clinic the hospital right you can cause i m downtown and all that right right right i m i i what i will do i will look for the saturday appointments and get these some of these things done okay the only thing is i can do that colonoscopy can t be done on a saturday it cannot ? no it can t well at least i can get two of them out of the way on a saturday you can get two of them out of the way i can start with those two alright very good i can start with those two i will give you a referral for those now the colonoscopy ah you know why it is time right ? to look for cancer ? to look for cancer generally small polyps yeah that s right well who has the big science fair science has this big display of the colon and the man was inside touching and it was in a newspaper yeah they had the big polyps all on the side you could walk through and touch them you know what i m talking about at the science center here ? i know have you heard about it though from your friends about what it involves and the test itself ? most people i know my age that know about it are supposed to have it done and they re bad as i am they my supervisor at work why is that ? i don t know she keeps telling her doctor cause i told her how i m pressured to do that mm hmm she told me to tell my doctor the same thing she tells hers okay let s alright i m not ready for it let me correct you let me correct you no pressure i know there s no pressure to do anything but i should get it done but if i were you yeah i know i would get it done so ah there are other options too but ultimately i mean we can do stool cards once a year ah to check for cancer but ultimately the ultimate test is colonoscopy so there are other tests like stool cards and flexible sigmoidoscopy which is a shorter version of colonoscopy mm hmm and then there s ah actually called barium enema which actually is no longer advised we don t do that anymore so we have three options here stool cards once a year every year you know you take those cards home put the stool on it send it back it s it s quite gross yeah i i yeah you done it ? what happens with what kind of test is it ? what do they do ? colonoscopy ? mm hmm what happens ? what do you do ? well they kind of sedate you put you out not anesthetized they sedate you sedate you so you re partially awake partially asleep anesthesiologist comes in ? no no not that serious no no no no they just give you a medication to sedate you okay a pill or something ? no iv so and then they put a small tube it s this size where ? up your rectum no wonder all the old gals ah well okay that s the holdup on people yeah but but but just think about this pap smear yeah i know right right ? i haven t had that done in awhile exactly but you still get it done yeah not since the hysterectomy i haven t been in yeah but you still get it done yeah that s true so this is done once in ten years if it is normal and most of the time it is it s normal yeah so they put in a small tube mm hmm it s about that long and then it goes longer and then go through the whole colon and look at it it s very flexible tube so you don t feel the pain we re going to start with the pap and the um alright and then what i want you to do is read more about colonoscopy alright ? that s why people don t want it because it is inconvenient so when that thing is going all through you you you don t realize it oh you don t realize it oh absolutely not there is no pain involved no discomfort involved the discomfort is in the mind somebody s going oh my mind is just going for it there is somebody s going up your rectum yeah with tubes flying all around that is that is the discomfort but there is no physical discomfort there are very careful about that they make sure that you don t get any physical discomfort that s what cause that colitis ? is that oh probably that s a whole different thing isn t it ? yeah it s a whole different thing okay whole different thing yeah so ah or we can start with the stool cards i don t want to do that i you d rather do a colonoscopy ? yeah some day and you ll think about it ? i m going to think real hard about it i am but i can ah honestly say i can do the pap and and the mammogram and the mammogram let me get past those two no wonder people don t like that ohhh i didn t know they did all that in the past they used to do with the you know non flexible tube mm hmm but now it is very very it s like putting an iv didn t enjoy that either or giving an injection didn t like that either but you survive it ? okay that s right so it s i m i m growing up a little bit you survive things and and the test doesn t take more than minutes so it s actually a very very simple test um i don t know how many do they do they do about eight to ten a day really ? yeah because i mean it s the only test in the world i know which is you know which is great which detects cancer very early alright ? okay so let me give you a referral for a pap smear mammogram and then next time when you come we ll talk about colonoscopy some more okay now you always do the saturday appointments ? i mean unless you re in acapulco or somewhere but basically you do saturday appointments ?
three times a year
oh you do three times a year so i ll have to see you at other times okay well maybe i won t need to come in but once a year because i ll be so healthy no until your blood pressure is absolutely under control how often ? and we set you on a track you have to come three months every three months okay i need to see your blood pressure chart the chart we agreed to okay i can do that now that s very serious
good now have you got an eye exam done ? yes i just well i think last year i got new glasses new glasses they went i haven t had where did you get them ? um let me see henry ford the last test was here yeah they did behind the okay okay okay yeah i tell you i try to do everything here because i m in this area
because that is important because blood pressure affects the eyes too the old eyes are good yeah good eyes are fine i mean i wear glasses if you set the computer closer and i wear glasses when i m reading and at work but other than that not for television
what about the shots ? have you taken any shots ? hat kind of shots ? tetanus shot no nothing since whatever i had serious was done was at the hysterectomy so you need a tetanus shot it s taken once in ten years it prevents tetanus which is an infection once you get it there s no treatment for it the idea is to prevent it remember in the olden days if you get if you get hit by a rusty nail you take right i remember those that is one that test okay so that is the injection you take it just once in ten years alright ?
alright okay doctor oooh my goodness alright anything else i can do for you ? no um i you ll call the prescriptions into the lobby and yes i yes and i ll give you the referrals for the mammograms and okay no problem and i will get those done cause in three months you re going to wonder does did she follow through i m going to follow through on those two

how are things going for you at work ? work s good mm hmm um if i remember that you are you are ah ah working for an automotive firm is that right ? mm hmm doing the same thing delivering parts how far does that entail ? oh i drive upwards of about two hundred miles a day that s a lot that s my normal day besides all the walking and up and down stairs that i do at at the warehouse mm hmm
ah i thought it might keep me in shape but boy am i wrong two hundred pounds i can t believe it really ? well let me take a look just in for a checkup i understand right ? okay that s two hundred twenty two two twenty two no two hundred point two got your attention didn t i ? just tell me to speak up cause i i don t hear myself very well cause of this cold so if i m speaking kind of softly just tell me to yell okay ? so let s see where was it before ? to a couple of years ago a year and a half one ninety eight so ah it doesn t look like there s a major change in the past year and a half we hope that there would be you know it would be four pounds less as opposed to four four pounds more mm hmm yeah are there any concerns that you wanted to ask me about your health today ? ah kind of
mm hmm ah um um i don t think things are going to be able to get done through dr p as far as the ulnar neuropathy mm hmm well he has sent he keeps sending um sending me reports i got a report on that
okay that and the carpal tunnel is just driving me nuts mm hmm ah i can t let it stop me and like going and stuff and i think i m not sure um when i went to the doctor that he asked me to go to and then and i i went to him and mm hmm um the insurance company that they gave him wouldn t cover the visits the test or the visit and i think after the beginning of the year um i believe that i can only go up to henry ford doctors these were st joe doctors mm hmm
and i m not sure i i haven t found out for sure maybe e would know oh excuse me she s an innocent an innocent bystander mm hmm so she s probably not going to be able to answer our questions oh i
i i ll be seeing dr p ah next week and find out what i should do about that can you take over ? possibly um well one thing was was that it wasn t um you know some of the things the reason you are seeing dr p was because of continued follow up from the accident okay now these others may not really be they re kind of new findings so they may not really be something that one could say would be associated with the accident at least directly so that being the case it might be something that would have to be under your primary medical insurance and so if your primary medical insurance is through henry ford ah then yes ah there s an individual i can i can guide you in the right direction okay ? so in what hand do you have the carpal tunnel ?
my right okay and then the ulna is on the left ? both arms and a lot in the right elbow okay so so you re having numbness here on both hands pain on the right these two fingers part of my hand my forearm uh huh and then my shoulder will go completely numb in the middle of the night and ah ah so at nighttime you re getting problems are problems that you re getting during the day as well ? problems during the day are um like a stinging and burning feeling in maybe most of my hand my wrist mm hmm mm hmm like down in this area at the base of the um palm there and every so often i will feel something when i m doing like um like when i was just tying the um straps on this gown it will go click and i ll get like a shock to my hand mm hmm well there s probably some pressure on the nerve yeah um so let s see was there any study done ah that checked to see how well the nerve functions ? they did an emg uh huh yeah they did one mm hmm do you remember about how long ago that might have been ? ah two or three months so not that long okay cause that would be something that would be oh that s right and i see it in this note he said cannot recall receiving ah that report ah what could be of value for follow up would be to ask dr p for a copy of that report i can refer you ah to a specialist ah that ah could evaluate both ah the ulna and the carpal tunnel um i d say it s ulnar neuropathy um that s usually more in the ring realm of the neurological surgeon and the carpal tunnel ah hand surgeons evaluate but then also neurological surgeons do as well so what might make more sense would be for one person to assess both makes sense to at least to me doesn t it ? mm hmm you take ah and you have ah two things fixed by the same person all right it makes sense name ? mm hmm i do wear a carpal tunnel splint at night okay good and normally i wear um elbow pads yeah they can help with the ulna mm hmm have things changed at all since you had the emg study in june ? okay i just want to be sure i i feel little things more i guess okay i just want to make sure things haven t necessarily seemed worse to you in which case it s now been six months there s always the possibility that may be another study that could have some value so okay six months ah it seems like it was just yesterday or less i know it time flies doesn t it ? time flies so i see your blood pressure today looks favorable you re checking it on occasion ? mm hmm
good so and i think i renewed your medicines just recently didn t i ? for thirty days oh so i have to do some long ones
they they told me ah to call that i will take care of and then you re still seeing dr b periodically ? i see him tomorrow okay and how frequent is that ? monthly okay so has he made any changes in any of your medicines recently ? he changed my lithium mm hmm cause i i was having problems with shakiness everything from my eyes shaking to my hands shaking so bad i couldn t grab stuff right when it got bad mm hmm so then he reduced the dose ? yeah he that can be one of the symptoms the blood level showed that it was too high and
yup that can be one of the things there s a few other ah medicines but you re not on them that also could cause that problem as well okay all right and let s see i remember before you had a a hernia on the one side and ah that s not giving you any trouble ?
something is okay so you re getting some pain there ? ah i know what it is but um one of my testicles has gone up inside me and it s gone okay and how long have you noticed that ? probably a few weeks now okay and that s on that same side ? mm hmm oh yeah it s on the side that feels bad the other side it is tolerable and i also had like a little mass inside my scrotum i remember that yeah i think i might have mentioned that to you before that there was a benign finding yeah that was a it was on the cord ah going to the testicle and that s considered a cyst and ah ah from what we had noted before ah it wasn t a major concern okay i this seems like it might be different it s it s not a cyst type thing it feels like a piece of bubble gum mm hmm that s and i was checking it and the other day i i checked it and i started like squeeze a little bit and all of a sudden this big pool of pus showed up oh okay that could be a cyst on the scrotum itself has it gotten uh tender or inflamed ? it doesn t hurt or
okay um let s see i want your lab work done today see how the cholesterol s doing are you worried it might be high ? ah it was elevated before and ah at one point in time we had talked about ah taking medicine for cholesterol mm hmm and ah you did but only for an interval you didn t like the way it made you feel or ? i really don t remember what if if anything the cost all right well it s available as a generic ah the one that i had prescribed before ah it was zocor and it has a generic medication so this is a low cost alternative we ll see where things stand if things are in the same range as before ah it might really be ah a good idea to consider ah ah taking medication okay ? i m not going to force you
ah i take so many pills now i feel i understand i understand more pills
as far as let s see some other things ah ah tetanus booster you had one last year those are good for ten years um did we talk before about having a colonoscopy ? someone looks through the colon with a scope right we talked about it and it was set up and then my ride passed away oh that s right okay so it it doesn t seem like that s going to be that easily done at this point in time ? not until um i don t really know anybody if i if i can get the day off and get a ride and then there d be no problem okay well at the very least let me give you some cards to check for blood in the stool three different days that you have a bowel movement you just touch the stool with a stick put a little bit on the card with the date on it and then send it back to us when you ve collected all three and they ll screen for signs of bleeding all right ?
so as i remembered ah let s see i thought you had um um a couple brothers and sisters um i have a brother mm hmm who can barely walk right now and my sisters they have kids mm hmm one lives in howell one lives in westland and the other she lives in redford she lately but the family is her family is kind of messed up right now
so might have some difficulty mm hmm
all right one thing that s of value for everybody ah is if perchance there is a situation where your health was a fall or whatever and then the person that i would have as my advocate would be the one that would help to make those decisions until i could come to and talk mm hmm so it s a good idea for everybody to have i m kind of lost without my guardian you know she was my guardian so it s my best friend
that doctor i m talking about okay all right well we ll see in the past um you had gotten the flu vaccine is that something that you d like to get today ? sure huh i d hate it if i missed work
that s how i feel i only wish that uh flu vaccine would have protected me from getting what i have now okay all right now would you prefer that she leave during the exam or maybe just during the private parts or ? no as long as we re covered
over there we re all set okay and let s see just look right over toward the wall for me just take off your glasses please so two hundred miles a day so what s the furthest that you ever have had to drive ?
um down town okay so it s usually no more than like a twenty five mile or thirty mile ah stint it doesn t sound like you got to drive a hundred miles one way or a hundred miles a day no ah multiple times yes i know a few people who ah do other types of deliveries like courier and they ll find themselves going from point a to point b to point c and they re going all over the place there s no wax in your ears how are your glasses working for you ?
they re not that s another thing i needed i had to give up i know it s not your field but um see on the bridge of my nose here ?
yes mm hmm okay and then on the side of my head ? mm hmm i think i m allergic to my glasses it s possible yes i see that once you had them off my guess it s sensitivity to them what you can do is um get clear nail polish and paint the temple and then maybe around the the bridge ah with clear nail polish and let that dry and then that ll protect your skin uh from the metal how old are these glasses ?
almost two years okay so you may be eligible for some new ones that might not be a bad idea to have another eye exam
in the meantime well you could at least protect it so you don t have this problem ah these these are kind of a little painful mm hmm if you touch em i see that ah what you could try in the interim would be some hydrocortisone cream that you buy in store one percent hydrocortisone rub a little bit on those areas like before you go to bed and that will often help to calm it down but yeah ah i think you re probably right it s probably a contact reaction to the metal yeah your mouth please
so in your health care contract it probably says where you can go for eye exams yeah we have ah some centers optimeyes mm hmm um had you that s where you d gone before mm hmm like the one in westland ? i ve been pleased with them they go a good job mine are made out of titanium so you can sit on em and bend em and they won t break my last pair were as well unfortunately i lost them i was hoping to maybe get another set as i needed some new lenses but um and so then i lost them about a month before i was going to go in for an eye exam so then i had to go in for an eye exam and ah the only ah saving grace was they said as is often said at eye places when you go in oh we don t make ah lenses for those glasses anymore so that was the only thing that made me feel any better so i couldn t ah put new new lenses in in those same frames take a deep breath please
you lungs sound nice and clear oh one thing i think we might have talked about before was um maybe uh uh seeing a dermatologist for a skin exam cause you have a lot of spots on your back a lot of pigmented spots mm hmm some of which are a little bit larger than six millimeters in size and a little bit irregular borders and you know they could have a potential of of later developing a cancer okay ? right there there s one right here right here ? yeah it s a little bit of a cyst that s a blocked pore yeah that s benign it s not a major risk to your health but they can get inflamed but you got a lot of them here on the side it d just be a good idea just to have a dermatologist ah do an exam as well okay ? we do have two dermatologists here dr n and dr g okay dermatologist exam and i will see ah i said one percent hy dro cor tisone try the cream the ointment you might find s a little bit too greasy
just lie back for me please hm so and had you eaten today ? no not since six o clock yesterday you must be hungry you re just tough then huh ? a lot of people would have a hard time lasting this long i know we had an appointment a different date right ? was that an earlier appointment ?
mm hmm ah i had a oh a flat tire oh boy i appreciated your call times you think you re gonna get a flat you don t you know i hit a chuck hole that you don t even thing about chuck holes this time of year
uh huh and i hit this real big chuck hole i was on my way to the hospital over i said oh well when i come out i ll probably have a flat tire i came out and it was fine so it s the other way around when you don t think you re gonna get a flat tire yeah in the past miles sure enough i ve i ve gone out to the car and three different tires were flat really ? um how old is your car ? ninety seven um do you have aluminum wheels ? um it was it just where the the air was low or the there there was leaks the sometimes there can be some little leaks in the rims yeah i took em each time i took em to bell tire and they checked them and said there you go and it was fine mm hmm cause sometimes there could be a a a slow leak along the rim which is really hard to get rid of and you just have to keep on adding air every couple weeks you know checked it over and then they couldn t figure out why uh huh
about four of my cars and i i d always add air all the time hm so i ll put a little fix a flat i ow sorry to lay there too long no that s all right you step down for me please and i ll check down below you said that finding was on the left side ? right side
on the right side okay and the hernia if i recall from the past at least in my notes i thought i saw it on the left i see right next to it i ve had the left hernia for okay it s a good seven years so that you ve had okay so the right hernia is only three years old or so okay so now there s a pair all right they don t always have to be repaired unless individuals have a lot of symptoms when there s a bulge that doesn t go away or a lot of pain from it i do feel the testicle
where s the other one ? that easily either i need to have some imaging to take a look and see so um you said at least a few weeks since you ve noticed that mm hmm it s not been detectable ? that s where i get a lot of pain and sometimes it there s a lump it feels like i cross my legs and oh sure crush em myself sure there s the line there yeah there right in there hurts a little bit ? a little bit that s probably where it is okay cough for me please once more please okay we ll talk about it in just a moment just swing over the table please just going to a prostate exam it s not the favorite part of my day either uh huh the prostate the exam and also the blood test a deep breath please and push like you re going to have a bowel movement and breathe feel some pressure prostate feels smooth no nodules just the news you want to hear okay ? all done okay i just wonder if um the way my pelvis is shaped if that has anything to do with what s going on there well it s unusual usually um if a testicle does not descend it s usually from childhood and it s unusual for something like this to where it recedes so it s probably going to be a good idea to have some imaging to find out about the status of the testicle okay one just to check it s position number two um make sure there couldn t be any problem with it because we can t feel it have you ever seen any x rays of my pelvis ? to know what i m talking about ? no cause you had some fractures well you know how you got like two circles there ? mm hmm when you look at it ? mm hmm and then in there it looks like it s connected ? mm hmm well i m kind a like this it s really tilted so that could be the case i have one x ray want me to bring it in sometime ? okay well if anything this will help to at least evaluate the testicles and make sure they re okay cause you can t feel them so you can t tell if they re really for that done here ? no we re not able to do it here it d have to be at one of the other centers i think at the livonia or the west bloomfield center ah livonia is close
okay and for the neurosurgery ah i believe there is neurosurgery that s at the west bloomfield center so ah the hospital ? well there s not a hospital there just yet but it s open okay ? there s a a large medical center there well i know the one on fifteen mile i go by that yeah mm hmm all the time that s the one mm hmm and i also know that a new medical center there on the corner i go by that all the time there are some different operations that are there so i don t know which location they are but you re right some of them moved off the west bloomfield campus and they moved just down the street on fifteen the number sometimes after a day at work i can i can hardly write i can hardly write when i m working
because it s bothering you ? so it sounds like something needs to be corrected all right i ll refill your medicines and then she ll have the request for the ultrasound and go over how to schedule that okay ? i ll be in touch soon nice seeing you you too stay healthy i m trying all right try and exercise a little more and maybe a little bit of the weight will come off i ll try take care have a good holiday you too i m going to let you get dressed

come on hi m how are you doing ? hi doctor i m fine
good to see you dear thank you so did uh t already talk to you about the study that they're doing ? okay ? so you re not under uh they re just observing and at any time you re uncomfortable you would like them to step out please feel free to let us know at any time uh huh alright
okay ? alright okay so how have you been doing ? i ve been fine
okay um now i um wanted to uh kind of go over uh a few things with you you remember one of the things we ve been keeping an eye on is your blood pressure right okay ? so let s see how that s doing that s doing well okay uh that s one of the things we want to make sure we keep track of when we see you for your physicals okay ? so your blood pressure right now is very much uh on target okay ? um you you know um so we will continue to not do anything medically for it
um are you taking any medicines right now m ? no just um one of the woman s one a day vitamins with uh okay uh like a women s one one a day type of uh ? with calcium
okay alright now one thing that um i thought we kind of talked about a medication called for your bones ? did you ever get on and get started on it ? i did get started on it but what happened was i had a fire and i should i knew i should ve had called you okay okay okay uh huh uh huh but i never did yeah okay how long did you take it for dear ? that was the once a week medicine we had you on ? right for six months okay for six months you took it ? did you have any problems while you were taking the medicine ? okay i think we should probably get you back on it just because you do have early thinning of your bones okay ? and it is one of those situations where if we can treat you and prevent any further bone loss in the future we may avoid bone you know from uh hurting uh yourself like with a fracture of your hip or if uh four okay ? so we ll get you back on that and while we re at it i m going to and do some blood work just to see how your vitamin levels are particularly your vitamin d level okay ? the vitamin d level is often low in uh people who live in michigan because we live in the northern climes we re not getting enough sun exposure so vitamin d levels tend to be low and you know it s like um it s like a brick and mortar okay ? so if if you have no you know the the uh d you can t build a wall without both the brick and the mortar right ? so the um the um the um calcium um is necessary for your body to absorb or rather the vitamin d is necessary for your body to absorb the calcium okay ? and if you don t have enough vitamin d you re not able to absorb the calcium you need which is the brick and you can t build a wall without the brick and the mortar okay ? i understand either way you should be taking calcium with vitamin d every day okay ? no matter where your vitamin d levels are you should be taking it again why ? because there s a certain basic amount of vitamin d and calcium that our body needs okay ? and you need to be able to get that amount uh into your system okay ? so what i m going uh what i m going to suggest that you do is um i ll get you back on the i will your vitamin d level uh and if it is very low we may need to give you some mega doses of vitamin d okay ? those mega doses are typically given once a week or once a month depending upon where your levels are at i will tell you how you need to take it okay ? if we decide on mega vitamin mega doses of vitamin d then in three months we need to recheck your vitamin d levels to see where things are at okay ? uh no matter what we do what no matter what we decide about the mega dose vitamin d i want you to take calcium with vitamin d okay ? that you can get over the counter preparations like are just some brand names okay ? but it doesn t have to be brand name okay ? it just needs to be um um medication that you can uh it s over the counter i only mention the brand names just because it will tell you where to look for it okay ? oh okay but it can be store brand it can be or any other brand is fine okay ? um so the important thing is that you get enough calcium and vitamin d in your diet as supplement okay ? so you want me to stop taking the uh one a day ? the one a day you can take uh but the thing is that one a day does not have enough of the vitamin d okay it has a little bit okay ? but is doesn t have enough to meet your daily needs okay ? oh okay so you can take the one a day because it it has some of the other nutrients which your body may or may not be uh lacking okay ? but um you take one a day one a day uh as you re doing right now along with that take two of the calcium with vitamin d pills okay ? and um i ll just write um you know basically we want to make sure all together okay ? between the one a day that you re taking as well as the supplement that you re taking that you re getting at least milligrams of calcium okay ? oh okay i ll write that down for you so you know the number to look for okay ? alright okay so you look at the label on the one a day you look at the label on your calcium with vitamin d and you make sure you re getting enough so you re at least getting if you get or no problem okay ? but make sure you re at least getting of calcium typically the vitamin d is there along with it so you don t have to worry too much about the vitamin d just make sure that the bottle will say calcium with vitamin d vitamin d okay don t get just the plain calcium okay ? oh okay so i ll write that uh down for you on a sheet of paper so you know uh how much you need to take okay ?
um it s the um the other thing that i want to uh ask you about is we did your um um your pap smear last year when you were here right ? yes and i just had one with dr s in august august okay perfect so we don t need repeat that okay now what about your mammogram did you did he do it ? i have one i m going down today to have one done excellent so it s scheduled for later today is it ? okay yeah one o clock wonderful now you you ve not had any type of colon screening yet right ? okay now you just turned fifty so this is really the time when we talk to you about colon cancer screening okay ? now what we do as far as colon cancer screening what we can offer you there are different ways of screening for colon cancer okay ? mm hmm probably the most um you know um most thorough way of screening for colon cancer is to do a test called a colonoscopy okay ? so basically what their testing involves is that you take a lighted tube okay ? about the size of this pen maybe it s slightly larger than this okay ? and this is introduced through your rectum it s a tube it s like a wire okay ? so it s flexible and what the doctor does is that it is done by a specialist okay ? and what they do is that they with that lighted tube they take a look at the entire length of your colon okay ? to see if there are any growths or polyps okay ? and why we re interested in these growths and polyps is because these growth these polyps have potential to become cancerous so it s not that every polyp will become cancers okay ? but the polyp is the pre cancerous state so what we know is that if you have um about percent of the polyps can over time become cancer okay ? now if we go in we see the polyp and we ll remove the polyp okay ? we can effectively prevent that polyp from becoming cancer okay ? the reason why we start at age is that typically if we look at a population of people in general it s typically around age that we start seeing cancer uh going up okay ? so if we start ten years ahead then we can prevent those polyps and catch them at an early enough stage that they don t become cancer now say you have that now first of all when you have the test they will give you sedating medication to kind of you know make you sleepy so you re not uh made uncomfortable by the test because as you can imagine sticking something up your rectum and turning it around is kind of uncomfortable okay ? so you really want to make sure that you know that we sedate you that we aren t doing in the raw okay ? so they will give you medicine to sedate you you will need someone to come with you for a ride okay ? so that because after the test you will be groggy and not in a fit state to drive okay ? so you will need a driver to come with you okay ? for the test so that s going to be so when you make your appointment that s something to keep in mind do remember who s going to come with you for your ride okay ? um as far um so uh um so that is the most thorough test that can be done okay ? it does have some uh some complications that we need to be aware of you know there is very very remote chance it s considered less than a thousand chance that possibility if that were to happen most of the time these heal up on own okay ? there is a very very very tiny fraction of patients where they actually need to go in and open you up because there was a big hole okay ? but like i said i have really in my practice not seen that happen i m not expecting it to happen in your case but it is something you need to be aware of okay ? similarly you know when they go at take remove a polyp doing it is that they they re snaring it and cutting it off okay ? and at the bottom of the polyp they will um they will put um a to seal it off so it doesn t bleed okay ? okay okay but there s this very very tiny uh chance that it may continue to bleed even after they ve removed the polyp okay ? and that may require you to come back to the hospital maybe require a blood transfusion or something like that again the possibility of that happening is extremely rare okay ? in my practice i ve had one patient that it happened to and he had a fairly large size polyp removed okay ? oh okay so um that s my personal experience theoretically those are all possibilities okay ? um now there are other other tests that can be done there is a test where they look not at the entire length of the colon but a part of the colon okay ? but the problem with that test is number one typically they don t medicate you for that and the second thing is you re only seeing a part of the colon so if you are going to subject yourself to all the you know the the test you might as well have a full test done the colon test if they go in and they don t find anything abnormal you don t need another test for ten years okay ? oh okay but with the other colon test where they took look at only part of the colon it needs to be repeated every three to five years okay ? now you feel completely hesitant to have something put up your rectum there is um this kind uh one more test that we could do where we just send you home with these little cards you put some stool mail it back okay ? but the problem with that is we are not really able to see the polyps we re not able to identify pre cancerous lesions and get rid of them okay ? we re depending upon these to be bleeding and only if they re bleeding will it show up as blood in your stool now these are not blood that you can see with your naked eye because you d tell me if you saw blood in your stool so there are very minute traces of blood but you know they you know it s it s not it s kind of uh um it s a surrogate way it s not by looking directly we re just saying okay if there s blood maybe there s something bad so we need to go in and look kind of thing okay ? alright okay so you know they do reduce you know studies have been shown that even doing that is better than not doing anything okay ? and they can reduce your risk of uh you know dying from cancer okay ? but obviously it is a limited way and you have to repeat it every year and you know we really can t tell you know one way or another if there is a problem okay ? um with uh uh so the most comprehensive test would be the colonoscopy but of course that s a test with the most likely with something going wrong although even in that case the chance of something going wrong is very very limited okay ? um the test that i would suggest for you uh is the colonoscopy test just because it s more comprehensive uh and if you you know if you don t have any objections to it i can put in referral for it how it works is that a nurse or someone from the specialist s office will call you in about to weeks okay ? and set up that appointment for you okay ? and then that way you can have your calendar handy and make the appointment according to uh what would be a good time for you okay ? um when we do the colon test they will give you liquid to drink um which you need to take the night before okay ? mm hmm and what that is meant to do is kind of clean your insides because obviously you don t want to be sticking something into your rectum when it s full of stool because obviously they won t be able to see anything okay ? see right so they ll give you medicine and you know it can make you you know uh uh it will make you have loose stools okay ? so you know it s obviously a little you know so you need to make sure that the day of the test is free and probably the day before the test is free also because you re not going to be able to go into you know we don t particularly have you start taking the medicine until the evening okay ? so you just need to make sure your evening is free you can still if you had to go into work in the morning that s okay but you ll be starting the liquid probably in the late afternoon okay ? so once you start drinking the liquid you better be close to a bath room because that s the whole idea okay ? because they don t want to clean your uh you know your colon out okay ? oh okay so that that is there you re going to get the mammogram so that s really good okay ? mm hmm
now how are you doing with smoking dear ? i m doing real good uh huh because now i can like a pack i have smoked like one cigarette a day and i don t smoke any more until the next day okay okay so a pack really like lasts me like a week you know weeks oh going on weeks now now how long have you been able to cut back to that level ? about weeks now four weeks now ? okay uh are you taking any other like patches or gum or anything like that ? okay do you feel that you re making progress uh with the smoking ? do you have you set some kind of a goal as to when you might uh be able to completely stop lighting up that cigarette ? yeah when is that ? in december n december ? okay that s sounds fair you know um and you re definitely making progress from where things were before okay ? mm hmm but i just wanted you be aware that if you feel the need for some prescription agent whether it is a patch okay ? or um you know there are a couple of uh other medicines that are out you know one that kind of takes the place of the nicotine and the other which kind of works with of your brain to reduce the chemicals in your brain to reduce the craving for smoking okay ? you seem to be making good progress but if you feel either that when you get to that date when you set yourself up to quit you re still not able to quit or you feel that maybe you need to try something else okay ? i want you to know that you can call me and we can i can walk you through how to take the medicine okay ? and uh that will be something that we could uh do as well okay ? now you have hap insurance right m ? okay so hap does offer a program to allow you to quit smoking okay called the smoking intervention program okay ? and that is it s not like you have to go and attend any classes or anything like that it s primarily through the telephone but you do have like a counselor kind of a thing we know that those types of services do help patients um do a better job of quitting okay ? so if you would like to uh i uh i can put in a referral for that and somebody will be in touch with you okay ? um it s not bad thing it can t hurt okay ? if you find you what you really are not benefiting from these conversations you can just tell them look you know what i m okay on my own okay ? but i don t think there s any harm in uh trying uh uh that okay ?
alright ? uh the other things that um again um again now that you re we do recommend flu shots every flu season okay ? it s an immunization or shot that you get i don t i don t remember if you ve had them before right ? okay typically we advise patients starting at age okay ? but basically um it s a shot in the arm uh you can get some pain over the area just like with any other shot which can last for about a day or so you may feel a little under the weather feel like maybe you know you re feeling a little feverish or something like that but usually no longer than uh um no more than a day okay ? and usually taking something like tylenol or motrin will help you with work yourself through those symptoms okay ? i had my shot already this year i had pain okay but it just lasted for about a day okay ? but i didn t feel any other symptoms and i wouldn t expect that you would either okay ? remember the flu shot itself does not cause the flu because it s dead there s nothing live in it okay ? they re just taking some proteins from the virus giving it to you to allow your body to produce antibodies okay ? so it s not like the flu shot will give you the flu however we get the flu shot in the fall and the winter that is a time when we get colds and you know um you know sniffles and the colds and the sore throats so you you may get something later this week but it s probably something you were going to get anyway okay ? so it s not from the flu virus itself okay ? or the flu vaccine itself okay ? you re not allergic to eggs or anything like that are you ? okay so that s the only reason why we would not give you the flu shot okay ? oh okay so i ll have have them give you uh the flu shot as well okay ?
let me just check and see if there s anything else uh that we need to be uh tracking for you as far as your general health okay ?
and i m just looking at dr um e note on your pap smear it was normal uh okay ? so that is good um okay and you said you re going to have your mammogram right ? so you re kind of overdue for that so since you re going to be getting that today that ll be good and we talked about the colon test and you had your had tetanus vaccination when you were here last year mm hmm so you don t need another one til okay you re all set with that and the flu shot we ll give you today so you ll be all up to date okay with your vaccinations
and now aside from these were the things that i wanted to make sure i reviewed with you and uh let s just take a look at the bone density test um you know since you ve been kind of off of the medicine for a while i m going i m not going to repeat the bone density test right now but maybe next year or um we can repeat it again just to see how you re doing with taking the medicines regularly and taking enough calcium in okay ? so we won t repeat that this year we ll just wait maybe next year we can do it okay ? aside from that did you yourself have any uh questions or concerns dear um other than what the things we just talked about ? okay over all you ve been feeling well ? any shortness of breath or anything like that ?
okay now you ve had a um your cholesterol profile done in mm hmm it was very good very normal okay ? and so we really don t need to repeat it in um um for another uh five years okay ? so in we ll repeat it again unless something new develops like the pressure starts going up or your sugar starts going up or something like that okay ? otherwise you know it would be okay for us to wait since your last test was very good okay ?
alright um and let me just go ahead and examine you how s your uh vision doing ? any problems that you re noticing with it ?
i know i need to go to the eye doctor eye doctor ? do you notice that you re needing to hold things a little far away ? what about your hearing any problems with your hearing ? okay now the vision and the hearing are things that may change as we grow older okay ? uh now in some people it happens sooner than in others but certainly something to keep track of okay ? um do you see a dentist uh regularly dear ? yeah okay open your mouth for me you have dentures on the top ? okay aah
just hold this for me for a second mm hmm um you know when you smoke it s very important that you see the dentist regularly that they need to be checking inside of your mouth because one of the types uh cancers that we can get um with smoking is mouth cancer okay ? so you know um right now if you looked at the inside of your mouth you d see that there s some areas which are a little darker and those are areas where the the mouth um the inside of the mouth has been affected by the smoking okay ? doesn t mean that s cancerous but certainly you know it tells you that changes like that are going uh uh going on inside your mouth where we can t see it okay ? and um it s important that the dentist you know checks and looks at your look at your entire mouth make sure if there are any areas that look un unusual that they biopsy okay ?
um are you doing any exercise on a regular basis right now ? what are you doing dear ? i walk to work every day excellent how how far is that ? nineteen blocks wow that s cool and you re not getting short of breath or anything with that ? that s fantastic okay and how many minutes does that take you ? twenty five minutes that s very good okay nice deep breaths now now i know it s going to get colder so um have you thought about are you going still try walking ? because that might get a little hard right ? no no i ll be well i ll get a ride then as it gets colder a ride then ? now um you know at that time though you may want think about how else you might get that minutes of exercising ? well in my job i have to go up and down the steps all day long okay okay walk around the building from one side to the next side next side excellent okay so that is you know um so what our goal is that you know about minutes on most days of the week okay that we are getting physical activity okay ? and it can certainly be in in different ways to get it you know it may be somebody can go to the gym but you don t have to go to a gym you can do it by walking taking the stairs you know things like that as well okay ?
any pain or discomfort in your belly dear ? okay any drainage or discharge or anything like that ? okay excellent okay go ahead and sit up okay ? um take a couple more nice deep breaths we want to take a listen to the sides of your heart nice deep breaths excellent so did you have any other questions or concerns m ? so what i m going to do is i m going to do some blood work primarily to see if there is anything else that s like vitamin deficiencies that are causing you to have the thinning of the bone i think the main reason why you have the thinning of the bone is because you had stopped so early and also because smoking does contribute to adults okay ? but i think primarily because of the um i know the fact that your periods stop so early okay ? um so i ll write down on a piece of paper the what we talked about the calcium and the vitamin d and then um what we can do is um we ll check your levels of the uh vitamins and if they are particularly low i will let you know and then we can get on the mega dose vitamin d okay ? and let me get your prescriptions together and for some reason anything like this happens you misplace your prescriptions you run out of it you know just call me okay this not a big deal you know i can just it s not like some you know mind altering drug or anything like that you know you just call me we can just uh um send it on to your pharmacy there s if you re changing the pharmacy or something like that you know it s not a problem okay ? we can just um send it on for you okay it looks like we your vitamin d level was low um initially okay and we you know um so i think i would definitely like to recheck the levels again and maybe get you on those pills okay ? just remember that if i get you on the pills after you ve been on them for three months we need to recheck your vitamin d level and the reason why that s important is because vitamin d gets stored in your body okay ? so it some of the vitamins like one a day that you take if there are extra vitamins you just pee it out okay so it doesn t stay in your body okay ? but vitamin d stays in your body so we don t want overdo the vitamin d so at the end of three months we ll check your levels again if they re normal then you can just continue with the over the counter calcium and vitamin d okay ? but so if i do put you on it back again i want you to in fact what i m going to do is i m going to go ahead and uh give you the vitamin d prescription okay ? you won t have to get it filled until you hear from me okay ? but that i definitely think we need to get you on it okay ? it s once a week you need to make sure you take it on an empty stomach first thing in the morning okay ? and uh don t lie down for at least an hour after you take the medication okay ? you want this to go to cvs on dexter ? okay okay and the i m going to go ahead and give it to you but like i said you know um don t take it until you uh see me okay ? so it s once a week um so you ll be taking you ll be getting four capsules a month okay ? and um we will plan on giving it to you for a period of three weeks uh three months okay ?
okay right hold on to it i expect that we ll most likely going to need to have you um take it okay ? but this this way you ll have it with you so as soon as you hear from me to start taking it you can start taking it and come back in three months uh and you don t need to make an appointment necessarily you can just come here tell them that i told you to come back for this vitamin level and we can just have it drawn okay ? alright dear any other questions or concerns ? okay alright well good luck with your mammogram today okay ? thank you alright take care good to see you again good to see you okay so good luck with the smoking next time i see you right ? okay alright thank you okay you re welcome just stay here for a minute dear somebody will be with you to give the shots and the paper work oh okay you can get dressed though if you want okay ?
hi doctor how are you ? fine how are you ? alright you know this young lady s going to be with us today ? so how you been ? been doing okay ? mm hmm are those the medicines you re taking ? just to make sure that we we got the same thing you have on your record let me see here let s see do you smoke ?
never have ? yes years ago twenty five years ago is a pretty long time ago okay is that medication list correct ?
alright okay now there are some things we talked about doing in the past i don t know if you if you still want or don t want to do them you don t want to do that colonoscopy to check your colon ? no not now not now ? not now when when if not now ? that s what you told me last year it s been a year now so when ? what are you worried about ? oh i m not i don t worry about anything like that oh okay i think i m healthy i feel that i m healthy and i don t need it alright let me show you a picture of let me show you a picture because i ve had year olds come in saying the same thing and then you do the test and you find this that i m going to show you here okay see the thing about colon cancer is that it doesn t it doesn t announce itself until it s pretty much advanced by the time it s advanced there isn t a whole lot you can do about it what you want to do is you want to find it when it s early and when it s early it looks like this uh bring a little picture here it s going to come up here in a moment where is my picture ? well okay uh i know why it s not coming up okay now it ll come up there it is okay this is your colon this tube right here see it ? polyps when they come up in the colon they start off very tiny like that takes them about nine to ten years to change from that to that by the time it s this size it s already worked its way through the wall and it s gotten to the circulation and spread so by the time you feel something it s going to be about that size it s too late to do a whole lot about anything right there what you want to do is you want to find it somewhere here when it s tiny because when it s this tiny they can bring that scope in grab that little polyp pull it out and you re done with it it has no chance to change into that but if we don t go in there looking for it we ll miss the opportunity to get rid of it before it becomes a problem now does that mean you have this ? i don t know but if we don t go in there looking we re not going to know so i ve had year olds come in here i tell them it s time to oh i don t want to have it done i don t want it we talk about it i show them this they say okay let s try it by golly there it is now in some people they find nothing so in those people they find nothing you don t have to do anything for ten years but those people that have something like this you have to see them again in three to five years okay ? now having had this done to myself i can tell you that it s no big deal the only thing about this is getting ready for it because you have to take a laxative and go to the bathroom a lot and that gets to be a little bit of irritation but once they go ahead and do this what they will do is they will give you medicine to make you comfortable and make you sleepy and the next thing you know you re done you re not going to feel a thing uh huh okay ? the tube goes in through there it goes all the way up to the colon goes to the end of the colon and when they see whatever it is that they see that s abnormal there then they can take biopsies you know they can uh thread a little wire right through that tube it goes right through that tube and if they see a polyp here or there or anywhere they can take a little piece and take care of it mm hmm okay ? so what what they would see if they saw a polyp would look like this so this is a picture of an actual polyp where they ve seen it through the scope there it is grab it with a wire pull it out cauterize that and that s it healthy tissue looks like the rest of this here this is a polyp that shouldn t be there okay ? so do you want to do it ? what about march april ? okay what we ll do is they will call you mm hmm and they will interview you over the phone and then they can decide from that point where i m sorry when if you were to have it done there s three locations lakeside west bloomfield or downtown lakeside okay alright let s see are you taking aspirin ? yes i take uh well i did last night i don t take it regularly because it makes me bleed alright so once in a while you take it ? alright okay let me see over here alright let s see okay so you haven t had any heart surgeries where they ve put an artificial valve in ? and as far as we know you re not a diabetic no kidney problems you don t have trouble with breathing where you have to sleep with a mask ? okay alright very good okay so we ll send this in and they will get a hold of you alright now mammogram you haven t had one in several years well i m just putting too okay is there another reason why you re doing that ? not having a mammogram ? uh huh well you ve been after me so long about it so i decided to go ahead and have it done yeah i think it s important to have that done especially if you haven t had one in a while i mean if this one if this next one looks okay you ll be already over the age of it was there s probably a good chance that you re not going to have a problem after that no family history of colon cancer ? i m sorry of breast cancer i m sorry no no okay alright you re the last mammogram was in okay you had your bone density already in november so we re okay there that was good okay excellent alright and let me see alright and then let s see alright we talked about tetanus and pneumonia shots and last year you said you didn t want to have them you still don t want to have them ? well i uh tetanus where i work they um i m taking i have one more to go you have one more what ? one shot this is for tetanus or hepatitis ? hepatitis okay what about for tetanus ? no ? i don t get that alright yeah that s that s something you should have as a booster every ten years and the last time you had it was so you re due for that and the pneumonia shot is given at age it s a one time shot and you haven t had that either no i don t want that either you don t want that either ? you sure ? m sure okay is there a reason why ? other than i don t want it ? because this protects you against pneumonia and pneumonia is one of the highest reasons for people over the age of ending up in the hospital and dying and this pneumonia shot protects you against most of the bacteria that causes pneumonia not all of them but most of the most common ones well i still don t want it you still don t want it ? okay alright and the tetanus same thing ? tetanus yeah okay alright the reason why i took the hepatitis because where i work you have to have have to take it they that you take it so they demand that you take it ? mm hmm
okay alright okay alright let s see here we got that alright we got that anything change in your family history ? anything new different ? no ? just this this on my shoulder i want you to look at on my neck okay we re going to look at that but i mean in terms of your family anybody develop anything new ? because your your sister has diabetes uh uh yeah but that s about the same and my older sister she she s having a the memory thing memory problem in sister ? does she have alzheimer s ? yeah i think so how old is she ? she s okay any other problems in the family ? no no no ? okay alright and aspirin you re allergic to aspirin at a high dose ? that causes bleeding ? okay that s the only medicine you can t take ? at a high dose that is

yes a fatty tumor oh fatty tumor you looked at it before it s is it growing ? no sometimes it it disappears then it come back and it it hurts so it hurts ? okay if it s hurting you and it comes and goes it s probably time for a surgeon to take right here but would would they have to do a biopsy first ? they may or they may just take it out just take it right out alright let s have you see a surgeon for that lakeside you said you d like to go there s a good surgeon there alright so let s get you to see dr rp there dr rp surgery okay dr rp lakeside surgeon he s a good surgeon he s he s dealt with these problems before so

well let me review the medicines you re taking you re taking flax seed oil still ? how much ? uh what is it a day ? one thousand three times a day ? no no just one of them just once a day ? yeah i m going to put it in the computer here so hang on and um aspirin once a day ? yeah but i was reading something for that psa test that aspirin will give it a false reading so i haven t taken it for a couple weeks that s fine okay because i knew i was coming here but usually you take aspirin ? what strength yeah everyday is your aspirin g ? uh that milligrams eighty one ?
and zoloft are you still taking zoloft ?
and lipitor are you taking lipitor ?
and how about chantix ? uh no that s what i wanted to talk to you about you re still smoking ? well i quit and then uh two months ago everything was going uh crazy at work and the next thing you know i m sucking on them again
i thought you retired ? i did but august first my plant is one of the plants that closed for ford so i was forced into retirement i see so you retired august first ?
but you ve been tired even before that for a whole year ? yeah yeah um and how about uh advair ? are you using that ? do you have any breathing or wheezing problems ? oh no i haven t been using it your breathing s okay ? um well i i ve noticed since i started smoking again that i uh uh what do you call it ? um wheezing wheezing ? in my throat yeah you re coughing out any blood or phlegm ?
and when are you going to quit smoking ? um as soon as i can get back in that program you want to go are you in hap ? you can go into the hap program ?
yeah sure we ll do that today are you using albuterol for the wheezing ? uh no i ve got some at home there but i didn t want to start taking stuff until i after i saw you alright so you you re not using the advair at all right ? albuterol you have how often do you wheeze ? everyday once a week ? hmm actually i noticed it like last night when i was trying to go to sleep alright maybe you ought to start back on that advair so we ll renew that the albuterol the advair is a controller a daily controller to prevent the wheezing uh huh and the albuterol you just use when the wheezing or coughing is really a nuisance and bothering you okay ? so that s a rescue uh huh
inhaler you re taking allegra ? allergy medicine or no no no ? you don t need that for allergies ? no i haven t uh
and how about your thyroid ? are you taking that anymore ? now when did you stop that ? not too long after i started taking it i think i called you and uh i couldn t get to sleep at night well maybe that s why you re tired lipitor ?
ten milligrams of
omeprazole ? we talked about that omeprazole are you taking that for heartburn or anything ? you don t need it ? no i no you re not having heartburn problems now ? i i do but i ve been trying to watch what i eat how often do you have heartburn problems ? oh maybe once or twice a week not like it used to be it was an everyday thing
uh huh do you take a multiple vitamin ? yes i do what kind ? um something from wal mart my brother in law is a doctor and he he uses it and he said it s it s as good as all the other ones any other medicines or um herbal remedies ? uh uh the only other thing is vitamin c i take a vitamin c and uh that flax seed every uh how much vitamin c do you take ? it s like
do you have any allergies ? i think you do that dilantin you had that hepatitis from the dilantin mm hmm it s the only thing is the is that and then you had a seizure ? what was that ? the seizure problem after your surgery for the tumor ? i don t i don t remember what that was so long ago i i try to forget all that that was a nightmare yeah that s right i get i uh wasn t that the medicine for uh that meningitis ? yeah yeah that my skin gets like all burnt from it is that it ? they gave you an angiogram of your dye of your eye ? what s i i didn t hear you they gave you a test of your eye at one time ? yeah after that surgery i was having a problem with it yeah did that give you a reaction ? uh i don t remember that giving me a reaction no that was a long time ago year that was uh quite a while ago that was years ago you had all that done yeah but i still have a problem with that dye i had some kidney stones a few years back mm hmm and uh i was in so much pain i didn t know what uh they were putting in me and oh my god i had more problems with after i passed those stones uh with my skin again what do you mean by that ? uh it like breaks out just burns i had a high fever with it
okay are you having any problems with fever chills or night sweating ? uh no no ? your hearing is okay ? stable ? in the in the good ear yes yeah and your vision is okay ? any trouble chewing or swallowing ? nausea vomiting constipation diarrhea ? bloody or black bowel movements ?
are you having any trouble urinating ? good force and pressure ? are you waking up at night to urinate or ? yeah ? how many times ? um i average of twice two times ? okay and that s been stable for a number of years or something new ? uh the last couple years it seems last couple years ? yeah yeah
any diabetes in the family ? uh not in my cousins but they got that from their mother so it s not really okay your dad had a heart attack when he was your mom had cancer at age what kind of cancer did she have ? uh by the time we found it it was all over they re not really sure they don t know what kind ? where it started no alright and any heart attacks or strokes kidney disease in your family ? uh yeah well your dad had the heart how about stroke ? yeah uh strokes again my cousin but uh i think that attributed to the diabetes
yeah yeah when did you have kidney stones last ? you mentioned that uh it was a while back i didn t uh here or someplace else ? no they took me to well at that time it was uh st joe s
i see well how about uh prevention things ? have you had colonoscopy or colon cancer screening ? uh no no ? did you ever submit the cards for uh screening for colon cancer ? you did that in the past ? yeah but i i just did it uh the other day and it s probably not here yet the cards ? yeah ? where you put bowel movement on a card and you mail it in ? yeah yeah you you mailed it in here to ford or where ? because we don t have it on the computer yeah well it s like i said it s probably not here yet alright how many were there ? three cards ? yeah yeah okay well we ll wait on that one you know ideally the colonoscopy is probably a better test for colon cancer screening than the cards mm hmm okay ? but they re both valid tests it s just that the colonoscopy is better okay ? so but if you want to have a colonoscopy we can set you up a screening colonoscopy if there are no polyps or problems then we could you know probably relax for about ten years right now uh huh that s how we think about that but if there are um a polyp then you would have to have the polyp snipped out they do that right there and then maybe go on every three to five years screening but but it s a great way to detect colon cancer so yeah because my uh dad s father that s what he died from oh your grandfather ? well that counts how long have you um how old was he when he died ? uh in his s yeah so all of a sudden the colonoscopy s not an option okay ? you need to go get that okay ? i want you to go get that yeah and you can just call the lakeside center and ask for a screening colonoscopy okay ? the nurse will call and review everything it s pretty simple you know you re retired now you ll need a driver that s all you know so the nurse will get all the information over the phone and then tell you to come in after you prep yourself they ll do it and then somebody will drive you home oh okay yeah let s see your vaccines when was your last tetanus shot do you remember ? you think it was over uh ten years ago ? any bad cuts or injuries or trips to the er ? no so we probably ought to get you updated on that and then you ll need a flu shot in november okay ? oh november ? that s the best time yeah it s too early right now yeah i didn t get one last year and boy did i get sick did you ? yeah how about that ? i figured i wouldn t get sick last winter because i didn t smoke anymore at that time and then i got the whole works i got the bronchitis i got the whole works again and then i oh i got the flu on top of it
okay so i m going to enroll you into smoking intervention here hey it worked until i got all stressed i think a bunch of us went back smoking i don t know well did you use nicotine or no they gave me chantix ? yeah the chantix that worked yeah you shouldn t use the buproprion the wellbutrin or the zyban if they recommend that because you had a history of seizures so you can t have that one but the chantix you probably can use especially if it worked in the past that s the but it works better if you you know have the counseling with it so
yeah all these joint pains and all that be from my thyroid ?
sometimes yeah they can call you at home ? yeah yeah i m pretty pretty much available now you re not depressed ? i don t think so
okay so i think you re enrolled so you need the advair renewed for your lungs ? correct ?
that ll go to cvs ? mm hmm and you have albuterol at home ? yeah from the last time you gave it to me i don t know how long it stays good but yeah you can check usually it s you know a couple years but just check yeah yeah if it s expired call and we ll renew it okay ? and how about uh thyroid ? you don t have it but we ll check your blood to make sure you need it and i think you will and once we get the blood results i ll let you know about that
you have enough lipitor ? just renewed it in september so you got left there you ll have to call at the end of this bottle though in a couple months the vitamin c and the zoloft you have enough of ?
yeah i think the zoloft is good until the end of the year it seems like the last refill was though do you take it every day or forget ? you ve been getting it refilled ? the zoloft ? yeah it s something else now they it s uh sertraline ? a generic i just got it filled uh this month no problem so it looks like the only one that s going in is the um advair alright let me examine you here do you have any questions for me ?
uh yeah what s going on with this toe ? uh it looks like you got a little infection there it had like a thick white calcium or material that grew underneath it and i did you bang it or drop something on it ? i i must have and it it hurt it was like a like a white thing under it and then it uh finally uh i ve been soaking it and it uh like the nail came loose so i didn t know it feels a lot better
that s pretty good you know sometimes the lipitor can cause muscle aches too have you had that before ? had the lipitor or the muscle ? the muscle aches from the lipitor no i ve been taking it for so long
swallow does this hurt when i punch you in the back on the muscles ? how about on the spine ? take some deep breaths breathe normally okay ? it doesn t hurt your back ? how about when i roll your leg ? does that hurt your hips or your back or anything ? uh uh how about when i push here ? does that hurt ?
this toenail has been this way for how long ? uh it had the white stuff under it it s been like three four five months oh and uh just all of a sudden it got so big underneath there it got to the point where i couldn t walk on it hardly and i started soaking it and it
alright do you want me to check your prostate or ? yeah i haven t had that checked stand on the floor you remember the drill when i m done with the exam you can put the soiled tissues clean up with this put the soiled tissues in there bundle it up throw it away in this trash can and then wash and dry your hands here alright okay it just takes a second a second too long one second too long yes
when i go for this colonoscopy um do they um seems okay great do uh uh is that the same doctor do something with uh the hemorrhoids ? um no but it can be if you want i mean it the um usually hemorrhoids are from a colorectal surgeon they also do colonoscopies but if you want we can have you see dr r for that and then he can give you an opinion on the uh hemorrhoids okay ? yeah so then you get two two opinions with one visit that would be a good idea you can go ahead and
get dressed and okay thanks
i ll step behind the curtain so screening and hemorrhoids alright ? now the one that the one that i m going to be going for is that the one where they sedate you ? oh okay yeah you ll be alright because i know years ago i had the where they put that little scope and look
yeah that s ? i uh i m trying to i take the dog for a walk every day how far ? how long ? uh usually we re gone for about a half hour okay probably be um good to do half hour twice a day at least alright ? how do you feel when you walk the dog ? do your does your back or legs hurt more do you think ?
um sometimes at night they ll hurt uh huh i noticed my back hurting more uh since i ve been retired well i m doing stuff that i normally didn t do before working around the house you know yard work things picking up bending over and all that is when the back has been hurting on the one side you know the other thing too you re overweight you ve gained weight since your last visit about uh eight pounds uh huh at your height you should probably have your weight down you know to about or less um so you need to work on that that s going to make your back feel worse it s going to make your legs feel worse your pep and energy and it s also bad for your um cholesterol so you need to cut back on your calories where you can the most important thing though is to increase your daily activity to burn off calories too so
you need to do both and um so you got a lot going on here okay ? you need the colonoscopy so that s number one you can call and schedule that i want you to stop your lipitor for two weeks to see if your muscle aches get better and your fatigue lipitor can cause that sometime and then you call me back in a couple weeks leave a message if you re better worse or no different if you re much better we ll try a different cholesterol medicine if you re no different you go back on it okay ? i know you had me on another one and that one definitely every time i did something yeah i remember that zocor probably yeah i was having muscle problems and then the lumbosacral spine x ray i want to get that because of your leg and back pain make sure you re okay there you ll get a flu shot in the fall november well it s already fall it s autumn now and then um your tetanus vaccine today
oh okay you can go see the dermatologist for your toe because i think you have a fungus they like to culture maybe put you on a pill therapy for that
okay i didn t eat so yeah i m going to draw blood today oh okay they ll come in and we ll get the whole thing and uh and then i ll probably mostly likely be in contact with you regarding your cholesterol and your thyroid i have a feeling there will be some abnormality i ll need to discuss with you okay ?
but you know that exercise just has to go up and pretend i m your boss okay ? you re retired now and i m going to give you a job right ? and it s going to be one hour a day and that job is exercise after that you get to play you get to do whatever you want so if everybody had a job like that they d think that s a pretty cool job right ? you have to look at exercise as an obligation you know you have to do that six seven times a week uh huh because it ll get you through the next years people who don t exercise just don t do well as they uh huh age so and then get that weight down yeah and what kind of exercise you talking about ? just walking is great it doesn t have to be anything fancy you don t have to join a gym so you know when it s nasty out with snow and ice or rain you can go to the mall you can go to you know home depot or lowe s and walk around you know and um you know they actually say that since um about until now we exercise calories less than we did in the early s but we have cars you know we have vending machines we have prepared food we go to the grocery store instead of the field for our food um we have our garages attached to the house so we don t even walk to a detached garage anymore we park close and take the elevators and escalators and so the whole society is less active and you know the rate of obesity from has gone from one percent of the population to percent and with that comes a whole bunch of diabetes and heart and cholesterol blood pressure stroke complications so you know being active and walking and no penalty for walking the dog twice a day two hours mm hmm and some people do that and and they feel terrific
they feel better they re more productive so so do the best you can with all that and um alright i think that s about it then in general i don t find anything dramatically wrong or worrisome for you okay ? you just need a tune up and then they ll call you for the smoking intervention as well the heart sounded good ? heart sounds good everything else seems good i think maybe come back and see me in about six months okay ?
and we ll just go over your weight and general health and at that time see how your mood is doing does your mood kind of slump in the winter ? or you re okay with the winter ? no it slumps does it ? yeah it slumped since i retired you feel like you need to talk to somebody or ? yeah i don t know never never hurts i guess yeah you want to go see a counselor ? you you feel like you re i thought you said before your depression s okay but yeah it you know some days i m good and then other days i is it because you re just feeling tired all the time or ? yeah yeah yeah no
sometimes the thyroid augments the zoloft uh huh and if you re low on thyroid that can kind of complicate all this
well maybe i ll see you back instead of six months why don t we make it about six weeks okay ? and then we can reassess because i have a feeling you re going to go back on the thyroid and then we ll see in general how you re feeling yeah okay ? alright take care bye bye

alright now the other thing as far health maintenance is a couple things one is uh um there s a um a vaccine out for shingles shingles have you heard of shingles ? no ? it s an infection that uh it can it tends to cause a skin rash but it tends to cause pain and there s a vaccine out now that lowers the likelihood of your getting it and what s the risk or what would cause that ? in what environment would i get it ? well um actually just uh age is a risk factor for getting it oh okay uh it s recommended for people over it s actually a reactivation of the chicken pox vaccine most people have had chicken pox so anyway we re not going to give it today what we re going to do is order it and hopefully they ll contact you about getting it okay ? but the other thing as far as health maintenance or preventive treatment is um a colonoscopy yeah you mentioned that last time i didn t go for it but i found out from a friend of mine his wife uh they went in somehow they got scared when the doctor started telling them about what could be the uh huh delayed it for two years and now she s got cancer okay well so she was scared away so what is what is the risk in that ? and i also organ well it it well generally if they would puncture anything it would be the bowel the colon um and it does happen it s not very common i think it s something like one in ten thousand uh doing the test does save lives it s been shown to do that and um you know sometimes when people bring this up about the risks and so on and i say you know about like the risk of uh if you asked me what s the risk of if i was selling you a car and uh you asked me what s the risk of uh getting in an accident of of buying of driving a car what would you say ? well you can you can get killed you can get paralyzed you can lose a limb you know so there s a lot of risks it s just that we drive anyway we just we re just careful so it s you know it s somewhat similar you know it doesn t happen um you know it s we we try to be careful and okay is is there alternative to that test ? well there is a um external probing yeah yeah there is a test uh where they can do a virtual colonoscopy oh yeah it s done with a cat scan the problem is one i don t think insurance covers it two um it s the same prep and if they find something on the cat scan you would then have to have a colonoscopy to remove it uh three it s a lot of radiation you know mm hmm four it s not quite as accurate a test so i don t i don t uh so i ll send you back for the colonoscopy and that sound alright ? uh they ll give you the same uh the information it s out at uh lakeside alright your last tetanus shot was in november of so that s fine uh you ve had the hepatitis vaccine mm hmm

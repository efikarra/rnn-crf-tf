no we re all stroke heart attack family okay well um let me see how the cholesterol was last time well it wasn t too bad just the triglycerides was low but those should be coming down with the diet okay ? yeah i think the diet will get the weight off and would help a bunch of these things you those were higher in the past you did get those down a little bit already um okay so ah
well quitting smoking well that s that s the biggest but it threw my eating i mean i actually gained more weight i m starting to come down oh okay i had hit which is probably five pounds i was a good five pounds heavier than whatever you read cause you have my shoes and everything so i brought it down oh okay it was just hard cause i immediately developed an appetite hmm yeah so now it s starting to it was difficult okay i and the uric acid to i don t want to eat anymore well it s just avoiding over indulging you know ? that s it because well i eat at night too you know i ve been eating for lunch the subway their three gram thing then i d come home and have steak potato um cereal i mean just all over the map well if you re snacking too much then brush your teeth earlier and you won t want to go back and snack okay that s a good idea so set a time to brush your teeth okay well is is your den it just turns your mind off to eat it really ? you won t want to go back and eat just drink water after that yeah yeah it s become almost a hobby you know it s something to look forward to i got to get out of that well i m sure you can have your little treat afterward whatever but then brush your teeth after that and you won t go back okay okay good alright that s easy to try okay ? good idea
really you won t okay so she ll get the blood ah give you the x ray request and ah your referral to the gastro guy and i wrote i ll write down that saline stuff i want you to pick up and try can they do the x ray now or ? okay i just go it s across the hall okay alright okay nice seeing you thank you so you ll get a letter with your results and i ll fax this over before i send it to you can i get dressed ? um yeah you can get dressed you don t need any vaccines ah she s going to get the blood right here so if you can pull your shirt and sleeve up or whatever yup thank you
oh sorry about that yeah i did want to do an ekg forgot to tell you what does that check for if i may ask ? ah checks for effects of high blood pressure on the heart if it s affecting the heart we just need different deflections on the ekg to tell me what s happening with that and make sure there s no changes from a couple years ago okay ? here doctor and it can also tell me if there s any signs that you ve had a silent heart attack or whatever so you read it or do you have to have no i m i look at it i like to see how it compares to the last one we did we re out of ah tissue in this room too no change from previous oh i assume that that s good well ever since you ve been coming here from the very first one it did show signs of high blood pressure but it hasn t changed over the years it s been stable so we just got to get that blood pressure down to ah ah so you call me if have seen that with this pill okay alright good thanks
hi you hello a good to see you
good to see you and you ve met this other lovely woman who s with me ? yes we were out there talking and discussing what you re doing she s like going to be like a little church mouse you won t even know she s there all right i ve even forgotten why she comes i ve been doing this now for so many months i no longer remember too many too much water over the dam since then but i think it s legitimate anyways we hope
i hope it is so how are you ? oh i m doing okay the aches and pains my knees are killing me my back is sore but and you saw dr n yes yes i did he told me to do some exercises which i ve been doing and to start therapy which i haven t started and come back and see him in two months so the thing is he s so far out when i made the appointment i he was at lakeside now he s out in dearborn he s not at lakeside anymore at all ? no he s out in dearborn now oh that s too far for you to go yeah that s too far so i m going to call lakeside hopefully there s somebody out there now he probably has a representative do you have a number you have a number for lakeside ? yeah i ll have to see what step one might be and here i have well i ll make a list so we ll start making a list of things we make lots of lists some are helpful i think they are they jog our memory we get home and oh i need all the help i can get make dinner or make lunch and deal with somebody s problem and then we get back to it now what was it i was supposed to do ? and without the list we don t remember i don t remember so call lakeside
i m going to be at lakeside next month for my mammogram i made an appointment out there i ll have to get forget the date do you know how many years it s been since you ve had a mammogram ? a while seven years seven years yeah well i m sure i m just fine but i know you should do that more often but i ll tell you i m going to have it done sitting down and i m afraid to stand there after fainting the last time mm hmm so she said before you could have sat down if i d known well that s what i m going to do
you need to sit down so who at lakeside are you going to call about dr nelson ? you going to call the orthopedic department or yes i have to talk to orthopedic hopefully they still have well the department s still there i called them the department s still there and some possibilities i don t know who they will specifically want you to see but these are names that come to my mind that they might say dr k or n.h now she s a nurse practitioner but she s cool she s been doing orthopedics forever so she s just as good as a doctor in orthopedics so those are two people that i know are there who might be able to take over for dr um yeah it s just too far to go yeah n i saw him first time out at lakeside and didn t realize thank god i asked before i hung up oh he s still there isn t he ? expecting yes of course they said no it s dearborn so i said will you tell me how to get there ? yeah that s way too far so i ve got his note here and i m going to be giving all of these to you so to put into your personal record that you re keeping and also to have things to jog your memory you can look back and see this is what dr n said so this is one is she s not benefited from recent physical therapy husband asked about water pool exercise program and i recommended that strongly where do you find i don t remember him saying that but where would you find there s a it s a part of the community the community warren community center yeah it s a part of that hat s where i go and do my exercises at wandering river do you know that uh huh oh yeah it s my favorite one so you know where to go yeah i didn t know they had that as a consideration of therapy oh absolutely just do it and just enjoying it oh i just do it on my own just doing it on your own so i m going to put i think that s why my left leg right leg s killing me today is i was there yesterday and i tried to walk against the current i can t do that anymore i used to do it all the time but now it s better to go with the current at this point but maybe you ll be able to get back to against the current i d like to as we strengthen your help you strengthen your legs so here s that she s not having any benefits from osteoarthritis classes did he mention osteoarthritis classes at lakeside ? if he did i can t remember it okay i want you to ask i think he did but i don t really remember what was said ask about osteoarthritis classes i think they take place in the physical therapy department at lakeside well that s good they have a therapy place i can go to there yeah they do so i put pt here so when you call and ask about who to see you might also ask about pt and osteoarthritis classes if they don t know ask them the phone number for pt and then you can call pt because that s i think oh for pains ? yeah your joints yeah yeah did you ? he gave me some of those yeah i should have brought those i didn t bring those darn they have them at sam s club and costco you know where you can get them a little cheaper mm hmm big bottles very cheap okay no injections needed follow and he wanted to see you oh in three months which would be like january or february but that s way too far away yeah i have an appointment for him i thought it was november but i don t know i do not trust my memory yeah doesn t that say november ? yeah he wanted did he do this ? yeah well no the girl the receptionist did that yeah he didn t want to see you for well it says eight to weeks and that would put because that was the end of september that would put you into january but you don t you don t you don t want to go to no i m going to have to cancel that anyway so that s just not going to work yeah i ll have to do that soon
all right now now we have the cardiologist uh huh how was that visit ? it s been a little frustrating maybe for both of us you know the medication the high blood pressure medicine that they put me on then because my blood pressure kept going to in the s they took me off of it then i kept taking it at home and i noticed that in the morning it would be low it would wait a minute over night it went high in the morning it would be much higher sometimes higher than that so then when i saw them they said begin it again at one fourth and see how that works and it seems to be working fine all right so what is it you re taking now ? what s the dosage ? twenty five i think it is of what ? don t ask me i forget i should have wrote brought that with me but i didn t it s blood pressure medicine that he had me on yeah milligrams daily yeah they had me on took me off you re taking it at night ? i take it at night when it goes high by morning they were worried bout it going low and making me dizzy or something and of course that hasn t happened taking it at night s worked out very well and your blood pressure today it s going good i didn t think it bring it with me but did we take your blood pressure ? today ? yes you did don t ask me what it was i forget i don t see that piece of paper i ve got the diabetes here s all my paperwork okay it was good all i can tell you well was there a physical exam was there a physical exam form that you filled out ? mm hmm yeah i got the front of it but didn t realize there was a back to it did s give it back to you ? i no i haven t seen it s must still have it or it s with the papers and i don t have it either
this woman has it mm mm no ? search her just make sure
let me see where it is where did i put that darn thing ? oh got it got it we re back yes looking for my diabetes blood sugar thing i did bring that if i can find out where i stuck it well your blood pressure is perfect today yeah it s been doing doing very well it stopped being so low which you know is great because it was it was going in the s every time i saw them it was in the s yes indeed the way she sounded as long as i m doing all right on the medication i had a feeling that they would just leave me on that and i ll come back at a later time and have them check so here s her plan when she saw you on the th of september heart failure and currently she appears normal no symptoms they wanted to restart the milligrams daily take it at night continue to take your blood pressure twice daily and you re doing that ? great call the office if you ve got low readings and they would see you back in two months mm hmm i think i have an appointment with her the end of november perfect okay so hopefully it will keep going the way it is and just keep me on the medication great i m going to give you that that note see how that all goes
okay then there s your physical from two years ago and here s the last time i saw you now you haven t lost any weight mm mm unless you got a magic wand to do it i don t think that s going to work although i ll tell you i ve gotten so frustrated i almost thought why don t i just ask to see if i could get on the where they block up your intestine and your stomach and i don t think you re a candidate for that surgery because of the other because of your other medical problems yeah that s what i figured but you are do you have hap insurance ? mm hmm you are a candidate for the intense weight loss program at henry ford they would work with you would you like to try that ? i ve tried everything else it s just nothing i can lose i cannot keep it off uh huh it s called wow i forget what working on wellness register for wow working on wellness i m going to have s it s getting very frustrating i ve gotten to the point i just don t i mean i was underweight as a teenager you were ? and then well we didn t have cars so you had to walk everywhere i had to walk and the ohio valley is very hilly and then i came up here you have to have a car wherever you go and then i had six kids and i stayed at home with those children and i just i really got house bound and that s been a big problem but i thought going swimming and i used as soon as i found out i had diabetes i started to walk i ve always gone to parks and walked mm hmm but it hasn t done me any good well let s see they you know they re used to very obese in this program they re used to very obese middle aged people who have a healthy heart and everything s going fine for them and just eat way too much of the wrong thing you re different and i ve checked off things to help them understand that you re delicate and we want to be careful as we help you lose your weight so i said yes you re a candidate but never to put you on one of those intense low very low calorie with just supplement kind of things oh they go that they go that intense and i put down o your past history that you have diabetes and heart failure as well so that they think about those things yep well i think i ve done as well with my diet as i possibly can i never have seconds and i guess i ve got a sweet tooth i would say that would be if i do anything wrong it s the sweet tooth some people crave drugs i crave sugar if i could get you down to even your heart would be so much happier and your diabetes would too i would be so happy let s put i got down to let s see it was after i had my last child and that was years ago and within two years it was all back okay all right so s will do what is needed all right to see if we can get that going for you but then when i said register for wow that s what that is she ll give me the number to it s a weight loss they actually contact you all right we ll see yeah see how that goes
you got your flu shot today mm hmm
okay so let s look at this now i think we re ready to do this yeah that tells you the last what the most recent one is not bad where it s high in the morning i m still having a problem always remembering to take my insulin and i don t notice it until i see that number and then go oh i must have forgotten do you dose it at night or i i do it in the morning before breakfast i do it supposed to do it in the evening before dinner but i okay so you get distracted the evening one is the one you tend to forget ? mm hmm yeah i m going have i keep saying i need to start at taking it before i eat but by the time i make the meal make sure my husband s got what he needs i just sit down and start eating right away and i need to set it put my knife my fork and my insulin i think hopefully that will do the job i want you to make a sign i want you to pretend like you re a kindergartener again for a second and pull out some pretty paper and a magic marker pretty colors and make yourself a sign did you take your insulin and where should it go ? if i knew that i on the refrigerator door ? you know what my husband when i m doing something i focus only on what i m doing i may open the refrigerator and take things out i may not but you don t see the door i don t even see the door do you always sit at the same table to eat ? mm hmm usually i have the same place yeah that i eat okay i want it to go at your eating place okay i ll try i ll try it i know i ve got to do that it s so frustrating in the morning when i take it and when i see that it s high because i know hit has to be i didn t take my insulin just a little sign pretty colors a pretty little card it can be a x a yellow x card with orange letters on it just something and it s just sitting there at your place oh no i guess i didn t do that i guess i better go do that yeah and if i put it out where i see it because out of sight out of mind i know i put it at your place at your place where you sit to eat but you know these numbers are otherwise they re not too bad they re not too bad i m pleased with what you re doing i m very pleased let s see so we got around and around probably well all righty you are units in the morning and units at night ? of the ? mm hmm that s what i m doing that s wonderful i think i think that s good how long have you been doing that dose ? that would just be since the beginning of september ? yes i think it s when i saw you last and yeah it s been about that long
and you ve been taking that vitamin d pill every week too are you done with that ? the vitamin d that s once a month isn t it that one ? are you doing that one oh yeah you re doing that one monthly because you do it just all the time mm hmm i do it try to do the beginning of the month once a while i ll slip up but i usually have it
kidney disease doctor y i m hop when they say make an appointment i am going to make it with dr y rather than his assistant yes and when will that is that due ? i think it s january so it will be another month before i can even make the appointment going to see dr y january just a reminder that s dr y this is me are you still taking ?
is it no no no that s right i quit it last time i saw you i told you i d like to go off of it and are you fine ? i m i m having some problems but i m hoping i can just muddle through it and it will get better pretty much do you think it all depends on the problems and all mm that s it did the medicine help help yes oh yeah i had such a sunny outlook my husband would say oh you always se the positive side you re never upset when i m on my medication i m not well maybe you should stay on it then do you feel like you re just taking too much ? is that mm hmm yes i start looking for a place to hide you know i don t want to talk to anybody i m going to go in the bedroom and shut the door and my daughter called last night she was upset and i just did not have the wherewithal to really help her out last night then i would like you to take your okay i m hope i m glad you said that because really i think the same i d like to be able to drop it but i don t feel like i can mm hmm it s milligrams once a day i would like you to do that yeah i don t want to go on any worse than it s doing now how about the were you still oh yes i still take that
u still take that okay that s hypertension thyroid zocort a lot of pills mm hmm yes and any more i don t used to be i knew all the pills i took and what they were for and now i it s hard to with generics because they look different they do from time to time and some and the names are so different the other medicine was synthroid and it had throid you know enough that i knew that it was for my it was a pretty color too yeah so
and you re using your ? what s that ? no i haven t used that in quite a while i don t think it really helped as you say i have the lungs of a teenager when was the last time we did ? where you re testing the lungs ? when you re breathing into that thing she has you blow been a while been a while i don t over a year ? i would say probably well we should do that then do a pulse too and just say lungs of a teenager i said that huh ? you did i told you i was going to i was going to have a t shirt with that on there
flu shot ? i got it today you got it ? s just gave it to me a while ago
do you have the results of the last lab work i did last week ? i do right here is it how is it those working out ? the urine no growth okay i wasn t sure they had enough but it looked they did and it looked good of course you ve got that chronic kidney disease thing and that s what this is but dr y takes good care of you and that s not a bad that s not horrible and your urine looked good otherwise not a lot of protein in your well milligrams
is that high ? that s your kidney failure that eh i ve seen lots worse that s the thing because i don t eat too much protein meat you don t i don t care about meat any more i think as we get older we like it less and less just no no
and here is now this is your sugar sodium potassium potassium was how much ? it was and that s okay oh well that s yeah i think it was the last time
mm hmm creatinine that s that s again your chronic kidney disease and dr y is doing a good job of helping you and i think you re fine i m not worried about it you need to follow his suggestions but you re doing fine and so all of it really is good your thyroid was fine and your white and red cells and you don t you know when you get bad kidney disease you don t have as much hemoglobin your hemoglobin s fine so really is that ? i haven t got my glasses thirty one thirty one ? so it s really okay i m pleased and this goes to you too
okay yeah should have brought my blue folder i didn t didn t think well that s okay but you ll take that and put it in the blue folder yeah i ll get it yeah i will and then has anything else changed ? is there anything new in the family medical history ?
no my one son has moved out and got his own apartment so you have the form to get your mammogram the pink form ? yes i do yes all right and we re not doing pap smears with you any more haven t done one in three years what do you feel about that ? i thought i read somewhere that older women didn t really need it if you ve had all normal ones and you re and you ve never had an abnormal one you don t need i don t think you need a pap smear but i do need to do the pelvic exam i feel all right so i ll do that bone density it s been two years and so probably should do that whatever you think oh you re getting easy whatever you think dr s mm hmm haven t i always been a patient ? i worry about a couple of them if you mention a couple of them you ll get an emphatic no what are you talking about the mammogram after seven years i thought i really should give in a little bit yes yes i think so but when it comes normal then i ll say see i told you well one in eight women though one in eight women get breast cancer and the older you get the more likely you ll be one of them so i ve read that so that s they say if you live long enough you ll get breast cancer well they tell the men if you live long enough they ll get prostate cancer yes but i figure live long enough means or something
no we re going to keep you healthy all the way beyond so you re using the now and that s working well for you yes it is i am going to be i have actually learned from you and your experience with the i m going to be putting more patients on that who didn t respond well to the so that s been good um you re going to continue your walking and especially that river walking is so good for you oh the river yeah
you re going to get got your flu vaccine mm hmm
your two sons still living with you ? d moved out he was the one who was on drugs he s got his own apartment he has his so he s taking care of himself yes i hope everything is good i don t know he was over yesterday he stops by every once in a while i think he s doing good but i ve ever known the extent of what he was how things were going c is still at home he s the one who cooks and he s the one takes care of us he s the one i think suffers from something i don t know that it s depression but he isn t one to go and have it checked he s made that clear so he seems to be working out pretty good for himself he is trying to get a job and that s been difficult so i think it s the economy as much as he is he s into computers and stuff that s what he did when he was working
do you need a refill on anything today ? no i think i m fine i think we did all of that in august didn t we ? mm hmm
and vitamin b i don t remember seeing that in your labs if you have not had a b level we would we do want to check that so i m going to go into your chart do that by just a little blood test i mean is that a shot or is that medication ? if it were low either or either or but i don t see where we ve checked it and i m surprised because i thought i was pretty good at not missing those things so it s just hiding somewhere yeah so i m going to just run down this and see if i can find it you re hemoglobin last time was that s great here it is we did it in june and it was wonderful so we re all set
all righty
so now we get to take a look at you you don t need any refills oh ? no i probably have a few pills when i stopped taking it no i probably could use a refill okay how about while i m waiting for that to come up can you get up on the table ? do you need my help ? oh let me see what i can do these old knees computer is not working darn computers i swear they are not reliable do you want me to help ? oh yes frankly i think i need the help which side do you want me on ? either one either one is good there we go now if i can turn around oh all righty well here we go it did was that milligrams ? i honestly don t remember what it was it was yes it was it was working so we ll just stick with it ? yes please okay a year s supply you re all set
yeah okay good all righty is that a plate ? mm hmm not lower though the lower is your own ? on my own and you brush twice a day and when i can i always do one i don t always do two and underneath your plate is there anything ? any lesions any sores anything ? no i ve had some problems around my regular teeth my gums get sore when i remember to do mouth wash mm hmm that helps and the electric toothbrush yes they both do they do very well how often do you see the dentist ? oh it s been at least six months okay it should be every six months at least that you see them so you want to take care of what you do have
make sure your plates fit well deep breaths i want you to lie back mammogram is all righty yep now i do and you do your breast self exam ? mm once in a blue moon a blue moon ? mm hmm how often do we have blue moons yeah i know
really i think with all the other things i think that doesn t happen to me in my family i don t know of anybody that has has i don t know what that is i get it all the time i don t know if it s nerves or whether i burnt myself on tea or coffee or what it is i don t know and it just comes and goes ? mm hmm fairly frequently i get the least bit nervous or worried about something it pops up
mm hmm all right can you put your feet on the table we re going to do that pelvic exam all right do you take a multivitamin every day ? no before i found out about my kidneys i used to take what was it called ? starts with a c it was the one that all the seniors all were supposed to take centrum silver centrum yeah but then i understood there was some stuff i shouldn t take so i haven t taken anything because i m not sure what to take did you ask dr y about centrum silver ? i ve never met dr y not once it s always o that sees you ? it s always dr o and the diabetes counselor said you should make an appointment with dr y i agree and frankly it never dawned on me i could do that i just figured until you got bad you saw o o and then whatever that is
please sit up all righty come over and i want to see you walk now all righty i ll i ll have to limp all righty all righty over to the sink and back to me all righty okay that good old walking river will be good for you i m going to put this here
i like it okay my nurse is going to be back with you in just a minute all righty and she s going to do breathing and a couple other things that we talked about and then you will be done and ready ready to go this is your note for yourself these are for you and your notebook mm hmm thank you and it s been nice to see you and really things are coming together for you very nicely i m glad good yeah that s always i m very glad good to see you so when do i see you again ? six months ? six months all right i am doing good then in the spring long time all righty are you set ? i m going to sneak out the door then and my nurse will be in in just a minute all right i ll go ahead and get dressed is that all right ? yes yes you can
how are you ? oh hello i m here from the phd study thanks nice to meet you oh hi hi nice meeting you
i thought you was here for a physical ? no i just come in my regular cause i been in florida for awhile and i haven t been around so that s why you haven t seen me for awhile oh okay alright okay so how may i help you today ma'am ?
well everything seems to be okay except i would like to have the micronase instead of that glyburide pill it don t seem as good as the micronase and you re going to tell me it s stupid to think that way but that s how it is you think that the glyburide works better ? no micronase works better ? mm hmm those antibiotics boy they knock you out mm hmm okay but it s the same thing so you you want the generic the the i d rather have the ah micronase the brand ? um okay let me see i don t think that hap will cover it unless you have the on my card the nurse was just and it sounds like it covers both let me show you my card because from what i see the micronase is the brand name and the glyburide is the generic i would prescribe it if you want to but i don t know if they will cover it i can give you the script see that ? that no that s the generic that s the preferred that s the non preferred co pay but i m going to give you we ll see i prescribe it and then we ll see okay okay the glyburide and the others are great i do need some blood pressure pills though if i can have a prescription for that
okay could you do a blood work today for us ? because you haven t done a blood work in two years i haven t ? no i don t see anything in the computer here ohh like last year i had that let me look up ma'am and it was you wasn t satisfied with that ? nope last time is september of okay i can do that so what i m going to do is um we ll go over your conditions ah but i rather have you do the blood work first before we refill anything because we might have needed at the dosage you are on we might need different medications so if i just keep refilling your medicines without knowing what the numbers are i m not doing you i m not doing you any good i m looking right here
it s going to be high because i ve been in such pain i ve got infected teeth two of them for a week i ve been dying finally it s easing up
and it may be high because of that like i know when i took mine yesterday mm hmm it was like oh that that could do it
have you seen a dentist for that tooth ? oh okay good next week they re going to extract it
alright so how how about if i give you like a week worth or if you have some at home you know because you ll be paying the same co pay for just pills if you have the medication at home i would rather have you continue them do the blood work and then maybe come back and we ll through this visit but i do need i have no blood pressure pills i think i got one left okay that one i can refill
just for days and then we ll void today s visit you do your blood work you do everything and then you come back and we ll do everything okay why don t we just wait for the blood pressure too ? let s do it all at one time
so what are you going to do without your medicine ? well i m going to look in my other and since i come before it i may have some up there and what if you don t ? but i know i got one in my everyday thing that i use let me print a script and then you ll at least have it because you should not be without medicines especially for your blood pressure
you may stroke you know ? don t take that chance alright ah we ll do that s why i think you need a physical because we haven t seen you in so long one year so when i come back next time okay we ll do it at okay cbc

and when i take the nitro ? mm hmm how does it do something to my head ? ah it lowers your blood pressure opens the blood vessels in your oh so that s why in your whole body mm hmm so it can give you a headache that s one of the yeah that s one of the big things that it does because it has um it s open up the blood vessels going into your heart and as it opens those up it opens the blood vessels up everywhere else and it can give you a headache yeah too okay
yeah look at your eyes here mm hmm let s check your throat and say ahh
very good so no chest pain with this arm pain ? yeah a little a little i ve just been having so much it s been sort of mmm what s happening with the the heart specialist ? i don t know nothing nothing ? i haven t been back to him but it s just i just get tired it s a constant pain but as long as i take the nitro it eases up but it don t go away so even when you take the nitro it s still there mm hmm it s better but it doesn t go away remind me k what what do they say is the cause of the pain ? cause one thing i saw didn t feel as if it was related to your heart ? they re saying it was i don t know they don t they never tell me mm hmm it s always either it s not pertaining to my heart but i constantly got i constantly have these pains on this side mm hmm and i had the ee egg yes yes emg and they said it was okay too but i can still feel that needle going in and you know going through my arm sometimes oh like a needle sensation ? right you know they went into well it s still sore like you know mm hmm i can still feel that sensation where they went in there okay where you had the emg done ? okay let me take a listen to your heart
take some deep breaths can you cough for me ? hmm ? mmm one more
very good very good miss k you re still smoking ? mmmm i ve been trying to quit i did one week completely and that s all i could do one week was good so you did a week that says you can do it
that s cause there s so much stress on the job and then my husband died and now i m on the your husband died ? yeah he died in july and i ve been having to deal with all that we were separated and just been dealing with that and other things job pressure and so i ve just been trying to relax and go home do nothing and go to sleep after work mm hmm
but like i say i got this twitching in my eye which really you know it s just not so
show me where the pain it goes from like right here to right here it s all in your upper arm okay it doesn t go down below your elbow ? only in here does it hurt when you move your shoulder ? i i can do that but that s yeah i just couldn t do that but i can move my arm it s just a pain it don t hurt by moving my arm it just doesn t hurt when you move your arm ? it don t hurt when i move it but it s like um well i have an ache or or it s just a throbbing ache i can tell it s a different pain than than what i ve been having cause the others are mostly related because whenever this here gets hard i m like this so i m going to sometimes ten sometimes it s a ten ? and i ll just lay down i ll lay flat you ll lay down flat and does that make it better ? if i go to sleep and i wake up it s still there but it s not as intense
but then too i haven t had a mammogram then i thought maybe i should go have that a ha yes ma am i agree with you there i think a mammogram would help a lot uh huh so we ll get your mammogram order form so you can get your mammogram done mm hmm you don t need a pap smear done today ?
okay so we ll get the mammogram do you and you don t take anything that makes the arm pain better ? just my nitro no other pain medicines for ? because it don t go away i take tylenol but that pain doesn t cease so i don t take that i just take my nitro and it eases it up some hmm huhhh i don t like the sound of that um did we get an ekg on you today ? we need to do an ekg on you too i m just going to look and see what your heart looks like again my heart i know so your ekg is normal here again today i think um we may still need to do one can definitely get one and um orthopedics to see you to see if there s something more that s one but um no pain there ? so i push on your stomach now okay would you come forward ? just work it out so it s a deep pain ? it s it s a deep pain you can t rub it out you can t i put a hot pad on it that does nothing it just it s just there you know but it just goes from here to here mm hmm and sometimes right across in here
so i don t know but like i said this eye twitch that s really just got to me how do you ? yeah that yeah that s that s uh usually from from nerves mm hmm so here i go it mm hmm the older i get the worse it gets no no what s i wonder if cardiology let me go back and look at cardiology s note to see if we need to do something else with the heart doctor or not we ll do the ekg here too i had the um stress test ? the stress test and i had where they went up my but it was clogged only ? okay i d be a bit concerned if it was percent open no it was percent but percent clogged which meant percent open okay that s good that s good
well i was just going to ask something for my nerves mm hmm anything for my nerves cause right now hmmm mm hmm with the job and dealing with my ex husband well we were separated but i still got to be responsible for everything though mm hmm you know so i know when i m stressed cause i can t i don t do nothing but go home and go to sleep so i know i m stressed mm hmm i don t do nothing but sleep mm hmm in fact most of the time i leave work and i go home and i go to sleep and if the phone mmm okay okay i just want to sleep and that s what i do most of my time is sleep mm hmm and work no housecleaning just sleep do you feel like you re depressed ? i wouldn t so much say as depressed as i don t know if i m depressed i do you feel sad ? no i don t feel sad i just be i don t feel sad i just feel like i just want to sleep i just don t want to think you know what i m saying mm hmm cause i go to work and i m stressed and i m driving and i come home but it s just me at home by myself so but i don t answer the phone because it s always a issue mm hmm of some kind but i do know my nerves is i have outbursts at work and i can t control sometimes what i say what i do so i know that was cause of my nerves you know little things it has nothing to do with individuals but work procedures and you know what they ask me to do sometimes is overwhelming mm hmm you know what they do they say get up and walk it s your nerves get up there and work mm hmm mm hmm so i tell them i something for my nerves but i m wasting my time oh oh oh wow mmm okay okay i don t know i don t feel sad i don t burst out and cry or or that it s just that at this point i just feel like things are just overwhelming i guess uh huh just everything hits me all at once and it s just a little bit too much and like i said i m by myself most of the time i don t feel sad but i don t have any energy to do anything i have plants and stuff to do around my house but when i get home i just i sit down just and i just want to go to sleep which i do i just fall asleep mm hmm and wake up the next morning get up and go to work and go home but i know that s not that s not you not no cause i m only it s not going to right now that s see i get tired very fast i don t know if that but it could be just my nerves too mm hmm mm hmm kill anybody i don t feel like that i don t feel mm hmm i just want to sleep mm hmm so the things that you would usually do that you enjoy doing i don t you don t do those i just go home and go to sleep i don t i mean i know most of my time is spent sleeping mm hmm and i m not at work when i m at work mm hmm and like i said it s stressful there but that s a job and things changes and changes come all the time but mm hmm it s still overwhelming you understand ? mm hmm mm hmm so i m just trying to figure out what is my problem yes yeah is your concentration your ability to concentrate ? that s just it you re not concentrating on as long as i m at work i m fine i mean so you can concentrate on your job ? i can concentrate on my work on my job but other than that everything is else is just mm hmm like my house projects and mm hmm just sits there and i look at them when i goby and i get in my bed and i go to sleep and i wake up and go to work and i know it isn t it s still not right mm hmm mm hmm it is mentally or maybe it s just too much overwhelming mm hmm since my husband is dead her lungs and heart and she s in tennessee it s just a little too much right now okay okay you know i think we need to do something more than just me giving you a pill um just to give you a pill and say okay here this should help with your nerves that s um that s not i mean i m trying to work with myself you know i keep trying to tell myself go on girl snap out of this mm hmm you know but it s hard to do when you re right in the middle of it mm hmm and yeah like i said i go to work everyday and it s just a fight all day and then it s just mm hmm and as i sit in everything else i know it s alright and mm hmm it sure isn t yet but mm hmm i m working on that too you might have to get yourself help to work on that i ll tell you part of what you re describing well some of the things that you re saying sound like depression some of the things sound like um something called an adjustment disorder where we just feel overwhelmed because of so many things that are going on around us yeah i guess i can have but i don t know what to do mm hmm well this is what we re going to do right next door we have behavioral health services it s the door right next to this mm hmm on this same floor i want you to go there and make an appointment mm hmm and just tell them ah dr n wants you to be seen and you can say for adjustment disorder depression and i think you ll be in right away see what s the best medication treatment regimen to to do to help you to get there and when all of the stars align perfectly the twitch goes away concentration is better yeah all of that all of that s a part of it so all of that will go away and be better when everything else is is just a signal that your body is sending saying things aren t right here and i m diabetic so now i try to rest when i go home lay down sleep mm hmm mm hmm and that s what i does but it is not getting any better mm hmm you know my back is getting worse i m getting more injured at just going home and fall in bed i mean i do nothing but wash my dish and i do nothing mm hmm and i m saying that s not good mm hmm not good for me not good for my house but i mm hmm i just don t have any energy or the interest to do it to yeah well goes along with the with the illness that makes sense so at least you sound like a textbook that s a good thing cause you re following all of the symptoms of the of the textbook well it s just i feel repositioning yourself i guess mm hmm i don t know at this point
so this is probably not a good time for us to address the smoking sounds like we need to get you healthy and then um i cut i have cut back i have cut down to at least three packs a week instead of a pack every day i mean i m trying i just i m trying you know like i said that s good long as i m home and i can sleep i don t smoke mm hmm but long as i m home and things are smooth i don t smoke but the minute i get to work mm hmm that s when you start then i have to then i have to smoke i mean it did good for a long week until one day i worked it just so much chaos there mm hmm and i just anybody give me a cigarette you know how would you feel about something to help you with the smoking ? how would that i i have the for the the the inhaler or the the inhaler and i do i try to do that but it doesn t when i m at work it just doesn t do it mm hmm if i m at home all day it s fine mm hmm okay but if i m at work it just doesn t do the job so i m still trying to on a weekend i m trying to do those trying to do those and i m trying to do those as many days as i can you know without a cigarette but like i said when i get to work it s a whole horse of another color and then get on the legal aspects of this other thing too is just you know they trauma uh huh your own children are all mm hmm it s just a little bit too much do you think um hm do you think you d like to try something different than the nicotrol inhaler or do you want is there anything else the patch ? um there s the gum there s the patch there s the inhaler there s um a pill called zyban that s a medication that s been out for awhile um a new one called chantix that s um that s both of those both of those pills are supposed to help to decrease your desire to smoke working on the receptors in your brain so that it doesn t give you as much pleasure when you smoke so that you know you kind of lose the desire to smoke while you re on it the pill might help the pill okay okay you want to try the the zyban pill ? you try that ? you think is best yeah okay let s try that one and see
yeah because i got bronchitis too i was here last i don t know a week ago well my head was clogged up but they said it wasn t a cold maybe it was just sitting here mm hmm and she gave me a i mean um some antibiotics but it s mm hmm my i cough i haven t got rid of that i don t know if that from my smoking or mm hmm from the bronchitis okay are you still on the antibiotics ? i don t know she only gave me a certain amount so i did finish those but i still have that cough and i get hot mm hmm that congestion in my head it didn t go out cause it was just sitting there like i was telling you can you breathe ? i can breathe fine mm hmm i wouldn t know this was just sitting then she told me it was bronchitis so currently you don t have a fever or chills have none of the symptoms now ? no i didn t have the chills or the fever again mm hmm my head was all clogged i was just you know clogged up mm hmm i didn t have no cough or anything at that point so it was moreso with your head okay okay um your blood pressure is quite high today too my what ? your blood pressure i take that every night yeah your blood pressure was ah let s see if that s a little bit better after you ve been sitting here for a little while let s see if that s better um so your blood pressure was up and you re still taking the zocor the cholesterol medicine ? mm hmm and ah uh toprol and the toprol milligrams a day ? mm hmm
and the albuterol inhaler ? and the prilosec milligrams ? okay so um and an aspirin an aspirin you ve got an aspirin ? yeah an aspirin what about allegra d ? are you still on the allegra d ? they didn t give me my allegra d before i was supposed to be called up here they said my health insurance didn t cover it anymore ohh yes yes yes they don t cover allegra d they cover allegra and they cover claritin d so if you need the decongestant um the claritin d is covered the claritin but they supposed to have been called up and they never they said they never got an order for that down ah for the claritin d ? for the claritin d i can do that for you i ll give you the claritin d um i ll send that right downstairs so you can pick it up before you leave today so we ll do the claritin d stop the allegra you ve got the aspirin the albuterol the anaprox double strength are you still doing that one ? that that s a pain medication and i see you got some of the cough syrup when you were here in september th yeah that s when she gave me that and that and it the ah the albuterol inhaler ?
okay um what about the water pill hydrochlorothiazide ? i take that once a day with the blood pressure pill with the toprols ? you are on that one too do you need a refill on that ? the water pill probably but they gave me a hundred of the toprol okay yeah cause it looks like your hydrochlorothiazide should have should have been running out here yeah okay and i the lipitor you re not using you re on the zocor that s cause they said we um my health that s not covered either it s not covered right zocor does cover and you re on the milligrams is that i m taking that as well
and you ve got the nitrostat and you have the nicotrol inhaler and we re going to look at maybe trying the zyban to help with the smoking oh and the other thing that we have k i think we probably talked about this before um if you re interested in having if you re interested in having a um a counselor to work with you on the smoking at the same time ? we have a a group where they work with you over the phone talk to you you know setting a time that works for you you know whether it s seven o clock on thursday evenings work then the counselor will you know give you tips each week to help you to to keep from smoking and work with you to to ah to succeed yeah i need that cause i have to quit smoking by christmas oh i like that goal i promised my granddaughter you ve got a goal oh i like that yes i promised my grandbaby oh ! perfect that is perfect now let me do this i m going to give you let s get you enrolled in the smoking intervention program and that s what they do help you so that what you re doing succeeds um i am going to get that for you and refill your give you a prescription both for claritin d claritin d zyban what happened to that ? there it is with the zyban you ll stop the nicotrol inhaler cause you don t want to mix the two right okay okay ? and it ll be one tablet twice a day i ll give you some refills there let s see and so we ll do the nicotrol we ll hold we ll start with the zyban we ll get you enrolled in the smoking program so that you can be successful and most of the studies actually show that if you do um you know an aid the nicotrol the zyban plus the um the program your likelihood of succeeding is much higher and you know what the highest success is ? when you don t stop trying even if you ss mess up i had a cigarette well okay you had a cigarette but today s a new day i can start over again the same thing we have to do with our weight right ? okay i ate a piece of cake alright i ate the whole cake but tomorrow i can still do better so it s it s okay it s okay so i m glad that you re still willing to keep trying mmm i m trying
yeah i appreciate that cause that will that makes a difference okay so we re going to stop the allegra keep the albuterol keep your anaprox the cough medicine you ll be done with um yeah i m done with that you re done with that let s get that off your chart your water pill you re going to keep doing mm hmm so we do need to give you a refill on your water pill so you ll have that the hydrochlorothiazide which helps your blood pressure which i don t like today ah the nicotrol inhaler we re going to stop
that s because you know when i went in the hospital they cut you had me on a hundred mm of the hydrochlorothiazide ? on the blood pressure pill and they put me down to oh the toprol they cut me down to mm hmm it s tough to say again because the hydrochlorothiazide you re at a good dose with your toprol at the could definitely be higher if you need it and your zocor at the let s see what your blood tests actually look like were you able to do your blood test ? um it s probably too late in the day for you to be fasting today ? um did you get the order form from me k to do your blood test earlier ? no mm mm no alright um that means let me give you an order form to do all of your blood test have you had something to eat already today ? you didn t ? ! you starved yourself ? well that s an everyday thing i don t have an appetite
you don t have an appetite ? so i eat just well mostly i drink juices mmm okay you re sounding more and more sounding more and more like uh don t say i m depressed okay i won t say it i don t like we need to do something to help you you re sounding more and more like we need to be aggressive in doing something to help you i don t want to be depressed i just i want you to be better i don t care what we label it as i want you to be better and ah right now there s a lot there s a lot of opportunity to get you there well i guess i could be depressed i keep thinking i don t depressed they say when you re depressed you re sad you cry a lot and i might do that unconsciously but do you are you crying at all ? i don t know well i suppose well i don t cry all the time i cry at certain times i don t know sometimes i don t know why i be crying for but
well i m going to give you a a depression survey let s see just some questions for you to think about and note if if it s not happening at all or if it s happening sometimes or if it s happening every day you know let s let s see let s do that okay so um oh oh and three other big things madam three other big things so the blood test i ll give you the order form for and since you haven t had anything to eat today you can do it while you re here we ll do it you know while you re here um but you haven t had your colonoscopy either k that colon test remember that ? hmm i did schedule what happened ? i think i went into the hospital but that would be a reason that you wouldn t have gone any further with it yeah if you were in the hospital for your heart um could we do that um too ? those are done at lakeside main campus west bloomfield and fairlane i think where where would you like to go to do it ? fairlane okay so we will do the colonoscopy let me give you the number k just to call to make the appointment i don t see the form in here so i ll give you the number just call there to make the appointment and i m going to give you today too the order um um the stool cards so we can check for blood in your stool mm hmm and we just make sure that we don t need to do it sooner rather than later so i want you to do the three stool cards for me if there is blood in your stool i m going to help you get that colonoscopy at my convenience if there isn t any blood in your stool you can get it done any time this year as long as we get it done this year at your convenience mm hmm but the blood in the stool will tell me that i need to help you to get it sooner rather than later okay ? so the colonoscopy the order form for that your mammogram so what have you ve done your pap smear already for this year ? we done it we did it last year uh huh but i don t need a pap smear i ve had a partial hysterectomy you ve had a partial hysterectomy ahhh that would mean you don t need it so you only have your ovaries left and not a cervix or a uterus ma am that that works that works to keep you from getting cervical cancer you have no risk of cervical cancer this is for your mammogram so the mammogram your colonoscopy the stool cards your tetanus you re up to date with cause we did that last year and the flu shot may we do that today ? thank you ! you re so cooperative thank you thank you thank you ! yeah let s get your flu shot and you do you do need that too and if we get your flu shot you ll be up to date with all of your shots you won t need anything else you ll be up to date alright
dr you gave me what s that naprol stuff anapox ? is that for my headaches ? yes anaprox mm hmm um now if you re getting the headaches after taking the nitroglycerin know it s from the nitroglycerin it s just that it s just that all of the right after i take it it just feels like it but after awhile it goes back it goes back to normal it s just another headache every time i take one of those pills that s exactly what happens when we give it to patients too in the hospital it opens up your blood vessels in your head and you get a headache it opens up blood vessels to your heart so your heart gets more blood and you don t have a heart attack so that s that s how that medicine works so the big side effect of it is it opens up blood vessels everywhere including the places that give you a headache when i hear that i get yeah that s it s not you it s it s the medicine it s directly related to the medicine alright we may need to increase your toprol up again we got let me check your ekg we ll do another blood pressure check now that you ve had the chance to calm down if your blood pressure is still high or your ekg is looking uh concerning then we ll be increasing your toprol up to back up to the hundred the last time when you were here in september your blood pressure was elevated too ah i don t think i need to wait you ve had three readings where you ve been elevated now this is the third reading when you were here in march you were elevated at when you were here in september you were elevated at and today that s cause i think they lowered it they lowered the dose of the toprol so we need to take you back up so with the ones that you have at home ? mm hmm um instead of doing one mm hmm you can do two at a time you ll have a the milligrams and i will give you a new prescription for the that you can get filled today i ll send that right downstairs for you too so when you re done you ll be able to pick that up too on your way out alright so the prescriptions you re going to have downstairs waiting for you the new claritin d

no okay uh smoking ? uh yeah he still sneaks out to the garage for his cigar things oh cigar well obviously we have to tell you not to do that but um tell him stronger tell him stronger your wife says you must quit okay ? the american medical association says you must quit in the not to be smart but they say if you re only doing one or two then why even bother ? thank you that s the you know cause it s a habit it s not yeah they have medications and that to help people quit but you know for one or two a day i m not really sure it s worth the mm hmm so why bother ? yeah so yeah and the simplest way is not to buy them anymore you know really well yeah i mean he s been in the hospital for a couple of weeks and and not being able to drive for a while and so i don t obviously buy em mm hmm and he can go that long but then the minute he gets cut free he s you know so we won t pick on you anymore but do i ll tell you what every time you light one up think of the two of us over here and you know how disappointed we are think of your little grandchildren who wanna you know see grandpa and yeah okay i tried all that um uh alcohol more than a drink a day ? and no history of iv drug abuse ? okay well well uh sometimes you think about it
eyes don t forget to get them checked every year the glasses are only six months old um okay immunizations uh the only one to mention actually two to mention i ll leave them up to you one is a pneumonia vaccine uh that protects you against types of bacteria that can cause pneumonia um i don t think you ve ever had one normally it s recommended for people or older but people with chronic ailments also qualify and certainly you know you have a few problems that would qualify it protects you against bacteria that cause pneumonia it doesn t mean that you ll never get pneumonia you re just protected against those virulent strains side effects are few and far between maybe a little soreness maybe a little bit of a fever but that s about it and it is not related to the flu shot the flu shot is for viruses that s every year the pneumonia shot can he get a flu shot ? i don t know for some reason i had it in my head that he couldn t get one not unless he s allergic to eggs oh i we i don t know okay but um the pneumonia shot is you get once and then a booster in about five or six years after um you can if you want one we can give you one or you can think about it it s up to you you want to think about it ? no no you don t even want to think about it ? you don t want it period okay but if you change your mind it can be given any time of the year the other vaccine er mentioned is the tetanus booster um they recommend that routinely every ten years i don t know when you had one my your immunization record in here is blank so that s what you get if you step on a nail get bitten by a dog get stitches do you remember that from way back way back yeah i can t remember when he had one last either again it s recommended routinely at every ten years do you want one or not ? um maybe maybe okay if you don t want one again if you stepped on a nail got stitches or got bitten by a dog you d go to the er or doctor and they would give you one then okay so if you don t really want one right now i don t want to force it on you it s recommended if you want to think about it that s fine and again if something like that happened it s just make sure you see a doctor i think in your case if you got to the hospital and they asked you if you had tetanus shot recently you wouldn t know so you might as well let them give you one when it happens is that logical ? you can do that too yeah is that logical ? that way you know that you have one rather than me trying to remember or you trying to remember when you had your last one okay ? think about it does that make sense ? all right just remember if you have any major incident like that just make sure you get to the doctor
um uh okay did we cover everything ? um family medical oh any problems with chest pains or chest pressure with exertion coughing up blood throwing up blood urinating blood ? no okay mm mm very nice okay now is there anything you wanted to talk about ? is there anything you wanted to say about mm hmm what ?
wo things we wanted to talk about oh yeah
your ears i think he needs his ears cleaned out cause i m yelling at him all the time for him to hear and um we want to go on a trip the last three times that he s flown afterwards he s gotten the cellulitus or an infection or something can we do like a preventative antibiotic to that s not a good idea ? that s not a good idea because first of all we wouldn t know what we d be treating um and it d kind of cloud the picture the thing is you know it s always when you re on vacations ? the last three times he s flown within hours he s been sick with a fever how far are you talking about flying ? vegas the last time was only virginia we it was only an hour and a half flight he had a seizure when we got home he had cellulitis in his leg all the way up and ended up with the and the you know ? the only thing that i could think of is that you d be getting infections is it a coincidence or is there i d say it s a coincidence but the reason we get like a cellulitis because like you never have an actual sore it just turns red right mm hmm so usually you would assume that that s caused from just some break in the skin or something so the last time he was purple from his knee down to his toes now it might be you know planes are very dry and i know myself when i m on a plane i start to get dry throat dry nose it may be that maybe the skin or maybe is it maybe just because of the splint maybe there s something rubbing ? i can t seem to you know i would suggest just it sounds kind of silly but maybe just trying a moisturizer ? just kind of lubricate it daily while you re gone even like baby oil or just something intensive care mm hmm just to keep the skin moist trying to prevent any irritation or any microscopic break that can cause okay so something physically has to there has to be something break the skin yeah cause we know it s not a clot you know so i that would be my suggestion just to try that now the last time we were in virginia we did go to montecello and walk around and all that stuff so maybe it was a bug bite of some kind could have been a bug bite florida the time before that that was the next day but a fever with the you know it may just be you know when you re on vacation are you just more active ? like walking and that and it may just is it always the same leg ? it may be just the brace is irritating him and just causing it all right so i would try i m actually afraid to go i just dread the thought of coming home and you know yeah i good how about the actual pressure cabin pressure and stuff or walking that wouldn t do it that wouldn t do it no either be irritation i would you know educated guess either the brace rubbing it causing some problem or just the dry skin and sometimes even when you have the dry skin you might be you know doing something like this or you know or i don t know mm hmm this and that you know ? or the the back it s always coming home too we always get every place okay and he gets sick this last and the last time mm hmm it was actually he walked in the house and passed out on the floor you know that close to landing the other thing too is when you re on the planes i ve learned this make sure you drink a lot of water cause you know the passing out could be um a little bit of dehydration you know so you know when they come around you know the stewardess too like they water is like the only thing they ll give you now mm hmm um water um make sure you drink it or buy a bottle after you get through security okay he s not much and he s not much of a drinker you know i have to really on a really hot day take him water or he would just you know yeah no that could be a reason for passing out a little mm hmm dehydra so i would certainly make sure you drink on the plane because again planes are dry okay all right um and i ve learned that you know cause i used to kind of keep it to a minimum because i don t really like the wash rooms but um oh that s that s mm hmm i make sure now that i m well hydrated mm hmm seems like it s always at the end of the trips so i m wondering if just traveling alone isn t too hard for him or i you know he never seems to be ill ill you know i would try that and see okay all right gotta keep it lubricated i would you know keep it moist make sure drink a lot and drink a lot of water especially and especially if you re going if you you know vegas is desert you know if you re outside make sure you are drinking fluids okay ? cause it s easy to dehydrate he does not drink once you re in the casinos it s no deal cause it s air conditioned beautiful but even if you re just sitting by the pool or something just make sure you have you know i m not telling you to drink by the gallon but you know mm hmm make sure you keep hydrated we ll give that a whirl but that was our other concern we have not flown since the last episode now i m gonna just you ve never done this before mm okay
have you done this before ? mm hmm but not with you how are we doing ? good fine it s just i m just gonna do the physical now mm hmm do you need to stay or i don t know what you i don t care i can just pull that s usually what they do if that s okay that s fine with mr b is that fine with you if she stays there ? okay that s fine i just want to make sure if it s okay with you and with you too yes and mrs b yes it s fine
oh yeah ?
oh happy father s day thank you a couple of days late and grandpa huh ? yeah yes that sounds more like him i think she said or something i was like wow no it s oh okay let s see how that compares yeah you should see all the things the grand kids make him do he dances to farmer songs and now oh really ? p can get him to do anything she s gonna be two tomorrow oh how nice yeah well yeah that s what your pressure normally runs about how many grand kids you got ? one two three four four ? mm hmm two boys two girls mm hmm some friends of mine they have four married children and each child now has four children oh jees wow ! they just had the last one last week so they have grand kids and the oldest of the kids is nine wow ! you know the oldest one is five there s four and the oldest one is five but they invite me for holiday dinners but i don t go i stop by now this is the youngest is only three months old b is only three months old so that s a nice age from five to three months
you know there s not there s not any wax here yeah ? really ? well maybe he just doesn t pay attention i don t know just doesn t want to hear me you might have a hearing problem what ? what ? i had a gentleman once the wife was complaining they were in their eighties she said uh he never hears me in the evening so i just asked him i said do you turn your hearing aid off ? and he said yeah can you hear this ? yeah yeah that sound about the same ? yeah ? i d say you got i mean that s not a scientific test but if you have time i can have the nurse we have a simple hearing test yeah they ve done that to me i know we can do that i mean if they re not blocked then he s just you know yeah he s not very good okay good i he s had them cleaned out before so i just assumed that s what the problem was this time no he s okay right now as i we can do that today if you d like or we have ear nose and throat at lakeside no okay open your mouth please i ll just yell okay lift your tongue up please up thank you just a little smaller okay did the dentist check your neck and stuff yesterday ? dr s that s the first time i ever had the dentist do that he had us he had me put my head back and mine checks the jaw they ll check for tmj that s about it hmm no i mean he ran his finger under our tongue under my tongue and turned my head and pressed my neck up i thought ah that s nice knock yourself out i don t care very good very good measured it you know this man it s haven t felt this good in a long time ?
good maybe we should go on our trip now yup yup you re just going for a holiday vacation ? we were going just like in october or something just like i said oh nice take a couple days and go to vegas you know we haven t do you stay at any particular place ? no we re thinking of this time what do you think ? i don t know about you ve never been there ? you could go on the internet yeah that s what we were doing they have a i don t know pool that s a beach i mean it s actually oh that sounds nice a walk in sand and wave pool and stuff we thought just for the heck of it that and rio we were looking at we ve been at flamingo we been to treasure island you know we just we re looking for something different just stay at a different place this time and there s those new ones there s the new planet hollywood and and i don t know we haven t decided but shoot for um hooters ? i know there s a new hooters caesar s palace has a topless pool what ? one of them one of them yesterday and i can t it did say the one end of the pool is topless be aware for your children or something yeah yeah get off our son s in germany right now and i guess that s very common there they told him don t be surprised if you saw them out at the pool you know and of course he looked and didn t see anything that uh three weeks ago i was in greece and on the island of crete i was on a little day boat trip and it stopped at a beach because they were barbequing and it was topless and that was just normal yeah i don t know about that i don t know i don t know about that well we were in florida one time with the kids and the boys were probably like oh and and a woman got out of the pool and just took the top of her bathing suit off and it was changed into a shirt oh you should have heard those boys they came running in the room mom ! mom ! i was like well now they re and and now they re you know they re cool yeah that s let s have you take a deep breath in and out through your mouth please once more and again and again yeah your breath sounds are good you ve been out in the sun a little oh you have a pool don t you ? mm mm oh no ? okay you ve been out in the sun no he just he is the sweatiest man he can t stand his shirt on my poor neighbors because he doesn t wear a shirt except when he you know so when he comes here thank goodness i swear he d go to the mall without a shirt on if if i would go with him here you go i ve begged him to use a little sunscreen and stuff but i don t get anywhere with that either dr j will be all over his case when she sees him with that tan
uh no seizures since when ? oh man a year ago february that last episode after the hernia surgery oh that s right very good that s just no eating problems ? swallowing no trouble swallowing ? no ? okay take a deep breath and out no bowel complaints ? no constipation chronic diarrhea ?
the only thing that i could probably say that i ve noticed seems like in the last year or so is he s more tired i mean he very rarely can stay up past o clock is that just old age and heart thing or well it could be partly the medications too some of it can be habit you know especially every evening if you fall if you get really tired and it s and you say i ve got to go to bed um hmm and you re like wide awake at um hmm and it s just you know but the rest of the day you re doing okay yeah he gets up with me every morning at and usually takes you know a time in the afternoon where he sits down and sometimes he ll fall asleep for minutes sometimes he ll fall asleep for an hour and a half you know but no matter how long he sleeps in the afternoon he he s like you know but again when you re awake you re awake it s not like you um hmm yeah you re drugged or sleepy or you know dragging yourself around i mean yeah i know you get up at you do what you have to oh yeah you take a little nap you re just probably a creature of habit then okay and he is and he is yes okay you know he like i said the only thing it just seems like lately he can t okay well we re going to check your labs for things like sugar hemoglobin thyroid protein things make sure um also a level on your um uh seizure medication mm okay watch what that is um but uh but again now some people worry about like sleep apnea you know where those are the people that snore excessive snorers mm mm no ? okay and those are the people though when they have problems they re the ones who say i m always tired i get up at and i m as tired when i get up as when i went to bed we re not here to talk about me dear you re not going to talk to me cause you do want but no when he goes to sleep you do want a ride home ? you don t want to walk home today okay ? when he goes to sleep he is asleep a bomb could go off right in the backyard and he doesn t hear a thing he sleeps all night and then he s awake and then he s awake yeah and are you like me like i ll get up at every morning i just wake up you know ? we set an alarm clock every night and very rarely does it ever ring between the two of us one of us is up between and and i go to work at so
okay um part of the physical is to check for a hernia and a rectal exam finger up the rectum yeah ? can we do that ? we ll leave for that okay so call us when you re ready i ll call you when we re ready okay okay he s being very cooperative today yeah this is great can i help you ? no you ve got it now i ve got to fill your form out so okay can you stand up ? if you can stand up i ll help you i think that will be easier okay ? you just stand right there if you don t mind i ll just pull this down cause that will be a little bit easier i think i hope okay ? testicles are fine and turn your head and cough either way oh okay yeah uh if you can t you can t i can t okay okay yeah the rectal exam if you can just turn around um hmm if you just bend over uh huh and i will do this one two three the reason we do this d is to check for the prostate it s fine okay jesus christ those are my initials j.c see let me help you here i m trying to help ah that s all right good okay you got it okay

don t laugh k it s okay don t worry about it
alright let s see i ll start by looking in your ears here well you ve still got a lot in there
two for two both sides require a wash so if i offered you enrollment in a um behavior modification smoking cessation class would you be interested in that ? soon as i m done with my outpatient that i go to nights a week
for the alcohol ? okay open for me a lot of times those two go hand in hand so sometimes it helps to attack both you do have some periodontal disease with recession of your gums just lift your tongue up for me that s it okay remove your glasses for me a second please look right at my nose okay put those back on i don t feel any lymph node enlargement in your neck swallow for me please good your thyroid gland feels okay that s okay okay ? is that you or me ? i don t know it might have been me i m starving okay stop breathing please and breathe and stop and breathe there s no noises over your carotid arteries that suggest any blockage take some nice deep breaths in and out through your mouth
you do have some reduced airflow in your lungs likely consistent with some underlying lung disease from your smoking i don t hear any wheezes or any signs of pneumonia let me have you lie back please you ve never had any formal breathing test done before have you ? no sir that might be something that would prove useful for you see if you ve lost any lung function at all and give you and idea of how much sometimes that can be a motivating factor too and then i think you had a a study of your heart when you were in the hospital recall ?
yes i did yeah and i think we talked last time about ah they had mentioned that your heart s pumping function was a little bit decreased right ? mm hmm take a deep breath in and out in and out good i don t feel any liver enlargement i don t feel any masses at all in your belly do you get cramping in your legs when you walk a certain distance ? no sir your pulses in this right foot are a little weak i m going to have you bend this up a little bit for me good and also the pulse behind your right knee is weak you do have a noise over your left groin area called a bruit it s a sh sh sh that indicates turbulent blood flow so you have some plaque build up in the arteries down here as well did you fast today ? are you fasting this morning ? yes sir
i m going to ask you to roll on your left side i m going to pull these down some okay ? well you know you re to be congratulated you did a very difficult thing starting to battle that disease thank you
okay you re going to feel a finger in your bottom here i m going to have you bring your knees way up toward your chest that s it that s your prostate gland there and that feels okay i don t feel any nodules there here s some tissue for you you can wipe off any jelly and get yourself back together here
okay now i get to talk about you and let you know what i think we need to do to help you this is dr s dictating a preventative health examination on and pneumovax along with a bilateral ear wash period we would ask that he have pulmonary function testing performed to identify how much lung function he indeed has lost period we would ask him also to have a lower extremity arterial doppler performed with regard to his obstructive vascular disease period he will have his liver enzymes repeated today along with a serum sodium to see that the abnormalities he had previously have resolved period he will have a psa performed as well period he will be asked to make an appointment with gastroenterology for a colonoscopy period he will return approximately four to six weeks time to review these results and take further steps if necessary period this is the end of the dictation thank you rs md okay did you get all that ? can you repeat it for me ? just kidding you re going to have some blood work done today we re going to wash out your ears we re going to get you a couple of immunizations in terms of further testing i m going to have you schedule some breathing tests those will be done at our sterling heights center on to find out what your lung function is like um and then the other test you re going to have is an ultrasound of the arteries going down to your legs to see how much blockage there is there so nothing nothing too difficult for you okay ? and then we ll bring you back and go over that stuff this is a copy of your last visit note here with me and you can keep that for your records um you can go ahead and get dressed but leave access to your upper arms for the immunizations and we ll get this other stuff together for you alright thank you sir you re very welcome you have a great day you too
hi i didn t forget about you oh no that s okay oh no i know you didn t
okay so how are you feeling ? leg is okay right ? no i am in such pain doctor no ? a big big issue you wouldn t believe it major issue so what s going on ? is it pain or the swelling is coming back ? no the swelling is gone but just from that fall okay are you talking about the cellulitis ? mm hmm oh that s okay that s okay we re talking about yeah so the pain in the leg is what this is from that fall and it s just right through here and it s getting into my knee now and probably part of it is that once i fall asleep it doesn t hurt me thank god for that mm hmm or when i sit in my recliner you know i get my leg up i can sit there all night and don t feel any pain can you believe it ? but as soon as i get up you know like in the morning so elevating it it s fine it does it helps yeah mm hmm okay but uh trying to walk on it i can t even get a sandwich made without sitting down two three times because it hurts so bad and you know if i wait too long then it goes into my back and my whole leg and everything and i don't want hmm where does it hurt mainly ? is it your thigh ? huh ? where does it hurt ? right through here mm hmm and it can cause in here you know if i stand long enough or if i walk any i can t even walk very far mm hmm even less than when was the fall ? how long as it been ? it was january th three week so that s yeah about three weeks ago the bruising is better ? well there was no bruising not much bruising it really just she just the bruising just started last week yes last week just started so here ? yeah right and now that s kind of starting to dissipate i mean it was really one of those ugly purple rings mm hmm that pain here and then that was like i said just last week so like two weeks after the fall how is your back doing ? my back unless i stand you know long enough or try to walk mm hmm then the leg gets really painful and then of course the back you know those muscles those nerves all start affecting me and i said that s why i think my knee is now bothering me so much i m having so much pain with my knee mmmm and uh what are you taking for pain right now ? how often are you taking that ? um it s probably every six hours about every four hours oh four hours ? oh i thought it was so you are taking about four pills a day ? probably yeah i never really mm hmm does that seem right ? okay i don't know i don t remember
um cause i that was another issue cause i don't know it seems like maybe mom s breathing to me is sounding a little worse and i didn t know if it was all that acetaminophen cause i know sometimes that can have a but i don't know she can t you told her not to take any ansaids mm hmm so we re kind of at a loss should she continue with the tylenol s ? yeah she should continue with that that doesn t help much okay then she s going to need a prescription for those with the breathing though okay it doesn t okay it does not mm hmm but as such the pain she might be breathing a little hard because of the pain i have been so miserable i haven t been out of the house since i came to see you the last time mm hmm when i you know hurt it mm hmm how are your blood sugars doing ? they re they re not bad said they re not bad they ve been all they re under okay but i ll check it sometimes they get lower than are you on the of lantus ? figure it out okay the mornings are pretty good yeah i take that first thing in the morning okay and the evenings you it before or after you eat ? the what ? in the evening when do you check your blood sugar before or after ? oh i thought i in the morning ? before she before she eats before dinner yeah like before dinner before dinner but then sometimes i ll check it before i go to bed cause i once or twice i ve been in a real low blood sugar during the night and it scared me so mm hmm i check it before i go to bed sometimes
okay and also you re due for blood work anyway and i ll check that didn t i just have some blood work done here ? you had your cholesterol in september that was the last one you had in september the cholesterol ? that that s what yeah that sounds about right and october you had some more but nothing recent and you have nothing like the glucose or yeah nothing diabetes related i don t think i thought we went for blood work after when we came here when i hurt fell down that time ? no no you didn t have you didn t have anything done that day well i don t know i just an x ray yeah we went to x ray and then we came back up here and i thought that i had no the last time when we were in here was still with your cellulitis that was the last time you probably one of those and that was october or november mm hmm october you were in the hospital well but that that s when i had fallen oh i guess we were here cause they did the x ray yeah but you didn t have the blood work yeah but there wasn t blood work i didn t have ? no just an x ray
mm hmm and uh how is your breathing ? uh ask she ll tell you from the from the walk out of the house to the car i was terrible wasn t i ? and you know it scares me cause i hurt and ever since i had that pneumonia i couldn t breathe you know at all mm hmm i said i don t want that i thought that was such a scary feeling you know so i get scared when i get that pressure
did you get the flu shot ? we have given you the flu shot right ? no i haven t she had a flu shot yeah flu shot yeah and they gave her a pneumonia shot when she was in the hospital last year for pneumonia mm hmm okay
and now of course now with this whole thing with mom s activity level has gone down the hole and oh yeah it s since i fell to nothing
okay i ll examine and let you know and um as far as walking do you have a walker at home ? oh yeah i do i don t move without it so you don t have it today or did you use a wheelchair ? no because we used a wheelchair when we get here she can t walk in no yeah i couldn t walk from the car to here unless someone gave us some oxygen first no way cause like i said you know just we came here just from my house
do you get short of breath or it s you get i breathe yeah my breathing is so bad you re not on the oxygen any more right ? home oxygen ? let me check your oxygen levels again see where you are it it took almost till we got to s house for her breathing to get back to yeah i was just so my chest it gets tight ? course it s really cold out too but and it s it s scary it s just and i m not gonna catch my next breath and i got the what do you call it inhaler ? inhaler and they say you re not i shouldn t be taking it that often but i took it but how often do you take it ? well today i took it before i left the house cause by the time i got ready to come i was does it seem to help ? i well i guess it does for awhile but you know well it takes awhile before it does so mm hmm okay she had to use it while she was getting ready and then you used it again when we got into the car and then by the time i got in the car i mean that wasn t you know she rested in between though yeah cause i was sitting there awhile mm hmm but how often are you using the inhaler now the rescue inhaler ? not too well if i don t move around too much i don t need to yeah it s real absolutely dependent on that if mom can sit in a chair and do nothing all day she wouldn t need it at all it depends on the activity
now with the pain it s one more reason to just sit and not do anything oh that pain that pain is what s really killing me right now and it s just like so we re just getting kind of concerned about you know are we in a vicious circle ?
mm hmm okay and uh when did you quit smoking ? how long has it been ? about three years ? yeah i think it was maybe three years in october and uh how much were you smoking before that ? oh i was up to about a pack a day and you smoked for years ? since you were oh since i was about years old since you were what i quit for six years one time and then i started again and when i started again i smoked worse than i did before that but you know at that time nobody said anything about smoking being bad for you
can you get up here ? do you think you can mom ? do i have to ? i i can manage you on the chair that s why i m asking ? just the moving it just starts yeah okay that that s fine let me see how much i can do there and if i move again i m going to start hurting like crazy cause i ve been you think so ? but it s just starting to go away now and if i move to get up on that table because i don t i won t be able to do the breast exam nor the belly exam i yeah i figured that you know i told about that i said i hope i don t have to get up on that table ahh because it would be better it ll help you but because otherwise i won t be able to do the complete physical just getting up there no i don t well you want to give it a go ma at least ? i ll i ll give it a go if it gets too bad say it s got too bad then we will deal with it it s that well you know even just the height getting up on here that height i don t like cause i get dizzy
you want to get on the other side ? okay there you go yeah it wasn t that bad give me a breath get over your dizzy spell well that s about i need a pillow okay there s a pillow there mom okay yeah i know it slid down it just goes like under your shoulders as opposed to under your that isn t too bad right ? not too bad no yeah doesn t she sound fine ? it could have been worse
even that makes you short of breath huh ? yeah yeah has it been getting worse the breathing ?
i think so and i think it s from the inactivity of the last three weeks i mean mom has virtually except for coming to see you that one day she hasn t been out of the house even in the house she is sitting ? and when she s more limited i think in the i mean mom gets up if she has to you know she has to get her lunch she has to get her breakfast she has to go to the bathroom yeah and its um but that s you know her self care washes her face and gets herself dressed
i can t even make my bed up like i used to yeah god forbid that the bed s not going to be made up every morning but and i m not very good at it like she is but she says that s okay she loves me anyway or something you know so you know like if and i don't know if it s the pain issue also adding to it ?
open your mouth say ahh
i think it s today she looks more short of breath to me she what ? more ? she looks more short of breath yeah i would definitely say so is it just getting up here ? it s like she s any kind of movement at all i know i said and sometimes it gets so tight it scares me and i ll check your oxygen level it has been awhile you might need some oxygen now how many months were you on oxygen after you got discharged from the hospital ? not even a month not even a month huh ? i think the first follow up visit she had with you they did the level and medicare called and said okay we ll be coming and getting that cause it wasn t low enough and i mom she does you know recover yeah well that was the thing today she was like i don't know was is it about two miles to your house ? no maybe yeah yeah and it took her two miles to re catch her breath of course i mean and it s very cold out which is bad for you it s cold out though too right i mean it s always worse in the cold hmm ? yeah i know they keep saying that it s the cold and i mean make me cover my mouth scarf and all of that yeah it s very cold today yeah and uh your bowel movements are okay ? yeah my bowel movements are okay that s one thing i don t have trouble with mom that s not completely true do you remember we were going to talk to her she had to do a stool softener i took a stool test the other day and she s all all excited about that and i no i had a hard movement and why suffer and make it get worse you know ? so i have some that s not normal though but i don t use it that often no not every day ? no i do take one and i m okay for i don't know for the longest time i sometimes i think it s what i eat that s not right it s you know it s taking so much tylenol well yeah you re still having a bowel movement that s great would that affects the bowels ? yeah that will products are very constipating yeah it s very constipating then uh i m doing just fine a lot of my patients take stool softener every day if they have to take something regularl because of the tylenol s very constipating and especially with you not being active yeah i know the inactivity i know it s just all the bad things going on
then everybody keeps telling to walk walk and i m in such pain when i walk i just can t do it so it s here on the outside ? right right in here and it comes up in here i don t after awhile you know if i don t sit down or lay down it ll go into my hip kind of you know and like i said it s been my knee s been bothering me right knee ? like i said the last three or four days yeah my right knee when i m doing this ? not much mostly just so it s maybe when you put your weight on it that s when it bothers you ? yeah when i put my weight on it you know so both your knees bother you or it s just the right one ? no it s just the right one and the and the knee thing is yeah mom mentioned new like since the weekend yeah i d say about the last three or four days it didn t like that didn t happen right after the fall no that just started about the last three or four days i d say mm hmm and your back has been doing pretty good after the surgery on the back ? it hasn t been it s not wonderful but it s it s better ? real bad okay mm hmm
but you know do you want to sit up or you re fine like this ? no i m good i i m comfortable okay i m here so just when you need to hold onto me do you want to get down ? yeah if you re through ? okay then yeah you have to make her get back up i just as soon
okay now as the least amount of movements okay i get dizzy too yeah okay okay now just hold onto me and i can walk over back there okay okay getting like an old lady which i am old celebrating
not like when you ll be then you ll be a real old lady not like when you re or something i m celebrating my birthday or when you turn in january i had my th birthday so
now the first thing we ll check your oxygen level okay ? and also maybe get a chest x ray it has been awhile to see how your lungs are doing but as far as the pain in the leg it s all because of the bruising and the muscle strain it s no fracture the thing is especially at your age with the other issues that you have it might take awhile for it to get better and especially if it s to a point where it s limiting your movements so much i ll go ahead and arrange for like home physical therapy
where they can have you get up and get moving a little bit because it s a vicious cycle you sit down it hurts more you sit more you it hurts when and it s like your activity goes down quite a bit because of this it s not like it s a major fracture or something bad yeah each year is yeah going on but even the little thing like that because you have a bad back you have some knee issues everything kind of goes out of whack so that s what is happening if it were a young person no problems at all they would spring out of it right away but uh huh probably yeah well i could be more active but i said it hurts so bad mm hmm yeah that s the reason i ll have physical therapy come to your place okay ? oh boy and i don t even think you can go for the therapy sessions with you with it being so cold and with you being short of breath and if it s icy and so i ll arrange for home pt yeah cause i haven t uh it was after i was in the hospital that i think that was after the pneumonia wasn t it ? uh huh yeah somebody they came they had somebody came for a few weeks yeah mm hmm something similar because you have to get it moving that s the only thing yeah i know that s need and i m not saying it s easy and i understand it s not like you yeah i understand why you know you can mm hmm and i know they always say you know if you fall a break is better than this because the break will heal a lot faster ahh probably not when you re i can no no that s even worse you ve never heard that one huh ? you gone that day ? she fell asleep during that day make it better huh ? oh yeah but i ve heard this it s old right ? it need not be broken for it to hurt this much that s true it s just just because it s not broken doesn t mean that you re not in pain it can hurt really bad for the muscles i thought they said that bones will heal fast my daughter my said mom you must have pretty good bones you fell down a couple times and you didn t break anything ahh actually i was it s amazing mm hmm actually
she she s a the oldest my oldest daughter and very active she always was skiing bicycling swimming she fell down and broke her pelvis well she has osteoporosis now so well yeah she has the rest of us seem she s a teeny tiny little skinny she doesn t even look like she belongs to our family they told her that she had we all hate her although she has started to put on weight as she s gotten older so thank god it s more accepting in the family now but she you know she takes after my dad s side they were kind of smaller boned oh okay okay mm hmm but you know she couldn t get over either when they tested we re these gigantic polish people bone test said osteoporosis
and i think um you need to have one of those tests too the bone density test mom had one i had that done when ? a long time ago ? i can t remember well i m not i m going to say it wasn t that long ago she had it at taylor that was since my husband died i know oh really so i m thinking it might have been in the s ? i ll i ll check on that you know since the change of the century the turn of the century but that s as close as i can get sorry okay but it has to be every couple of years no it was since my husband died i know it was and he died in and so it was in that time somewhere yeah because we did we went to taylor for that didn t we ? mm hmm are you taking the calcium vitamin d pills ? yeah i m taking the calcium two a day ? two a day
okay and uh for now like i said we ll mainly concentrate on the pain yes yeah and your breathing because i want you to be a little bit more active otherwise things will get worse so i don t want you yeah i know that mm hmm i know but uh let me get the blood work and uh bone density test that s nothing urgent that can wait as you know but we ll work on these two things and get the blood work
any prescriptions that you need today ? no i m all well she s going to need the one the tylenol s you need a new prescription for that yeah yeah cause hers ran out and then i just brought some i had some at my house just to get her through the weekend mm hmm okay till we came to see you just wait until we had this appointment and i wasn t sure if she s supposed to be taking it but you said it was okay so we ll take a new prescription for that
well that s fine and uh is she due for the mammogram ? uh she had a mammogram in uh i just had that march november ? oh november mm hmm yeah i just had it this is february yeah it was november november of yeah okay so let s
and then what did you say about the breathing test you were going to take ? first we ll check your oxygen level the pulse ox that s what i meant the oxygen okay ? we ll do it resting and after you walk a little bit from the way you re breathing
are you able to walk mom ? we didn t cause we didn t bring mom s walker no well i just had my cause we knew we were going to put her in a wheelchair as long as i m hanging on to you guys oh the walker issue oh yeah the right hand on mom s walker is like wobbly and it s the pop rivet that s coming loose and i talked to the healthcorps people and they said if you documented that it was unsafe for use that mom could get a new walker apparently you can t fix them or they can t be fixed or i don't know oh really ? that s what they told me down at the heathcorps well s been she s tightening that screw every time we use it well that s true but it s a pop rivet it s a different that s the screw too you can t cause like the handle will it jiggles well that s not the thing back and forth like so this is not a god thing either oh okay so how long have you had the walker for ? since i had my since her back surgery which was two years ago and that s the two three years ago quite a few years no longer ago than that it s been about four or five years four five years okay maybe it s been that long but she s been using it on a daily daily basis for the last like two years yeah because actually she didn t use it that long after the laminectomy you know no i didn t use it too long cause she was using that cane for awhile but then it was just well she started falling so we said start using the walker mm hmm so let me get the oxygen levels first okay ? can she get dressed or ? she can okay ? because you might have to walk in the corridor if you can yeah i i think it you know maybe you could push the wheelchair i could lean on the wheelchair sure that would be a good substitute for a walker cause we don t have your walker yeah just something for you to hold on to because yeah that would be a good substitute for a walker
okay m your oxygen levels are dropping that's right dropping quite a bit when you walk so we'll arrange for the home oxygen again oh okay i hate the thought of that it's such a fearful thing to have around but there's sometimes so should mom should just use it when she gets like this or if she's going to do some things do something so it's easier for okay so because at rest she is okay it's only on exertion she is dropping right and probably in five minutes she's going to be fine yeah so if you want to yeah i probably make up your bed get your dinner get or maybe that will also help i don't think i could even get through that unless i took the oxygen that's what dr v's saying yeah yeah maybe remember it had like a foot hose or something i mean you could make it all the way through the house with that thing on it did yeah that's right i know yeah the one we had for dad yeah yeah no for you the one you had when you came home when you came home from the hospital with pneumonia that's right i did have one with the big thing sitting in the for a while didn't i living room i'd forgot i had that so if you're in your recliner and you're going to watch tv for a couple hours you don't need it but no i know if you need to get up and go to the bathroom you need it use it then so let me let me arrange for that okay ? and also i want you to see the lung doctor do we have to go downtown for that ? yeah nothing urgent but just to kind of mm hmm get the expert's opinion are you going to have a chest x ray ? chest x ray was just done a few months ago we don't have to i thought i had one but i you know i had mammogram and i thought maybe i got that all confused and also you're taking your inhalers right ? the ? yeah she's take those and that one and the home pt and the oxygen i'll have my nurse work on it okay ? and they'll call you okay okay okay ?

okay good alright and how long have you had blood pressure problems ? oh that s since i guess about okay alright and the irritable bowel is that something that s still bothering you ? or it s rare on rare it s so it really it s it s maybe times a year okay what surgeries have you had ? um i ve had a c section and a tubal ligation okay when was the c section ? and the tubal ?
okay and you are a lifetime non smoker ? no i stopped smoking in eighty okay how many packs a day did you smoke prior to that ? good for you by the way um it was one pack thank you one pack per day for how long ? um we joke i started at age five no well at least you stopped then you know kids fascinated with what their parents do so oh yeah absolutely um i guess i started smoking at about so seventeen okay okay so ah in you were how old ? in i was okay ah so you smoked for about years ? okay okay and alcohol at all ?
no just on a social maybe a few times a year and i have to ask the question you know to say i asked mm hmm no drug use ?
okay okay and your family mom dad brothers sisters any high blood pressure or diabetes ? yes both parents and i think my sister i have one sibling and i think she um has hypertension too now okay so both parents and sister have ah high blood pressure anybody with diabetes ? no one any early heart attacks or strokes early meaning for a man for a woman okay any cancer ? my mother was um uncle with colon cancer but you said just the immediate family ? right so so so no okay which uncle ? my mother s brother how old was he ? um originally i guess he was in his s mm hmm and then it reoccurred about ten years later
okay you ve had your colonoscopy in ? and it was normal at that time were you told ? okay i ll just double check that some of the information here and it looks like your mammogram was actually done in march of last year is that what i saw ? let me double check that okay so we need to give you that referral to get it ah done again okay ah let s just go over a little bit of review of systems here ah so now fever chills um no night sweats nothing like that ? okay ah no vision changes or double vision ?
okay ah no sore throat coughing or pain ringing in the ears ? no nosebleeds ? okay and no chest pain or heart racing ? um and no ah wheezing no shortness of breath ? okay no stomach pain or diarrhea ? your bowel movements are regular ? okay um no problems with joint pain or muscle pain ? okay no problems with urination blood in the urine urgency frequency nothing like that ? okay and no heat or cold intolerance ? and no change in your shoe size that you ve noticed no weight changes or or what do you think about that ? is stable been stable ? okay ah no rashes or bruises or any excessive bleeding that you ve been able to notice ? i have an eczema history but i really it s not bother okay and no problems with bleeding i do have a question though um i was taking a low dose aspirin also taking um um fish oil omega s and they both thin right ? mm fish oil not so much not so much ? the fish oil um it has some good effects on the heart ah you know it can reduce the risk of arrhythmia but the two of them together is not a concern not a problem as long as you don t notice okay cause i notice i m bruising more easily and so well and it s probably more due to the aspirin so i kind of stopped the aspirin i guess i should start up again you know what ? if you are only noticing a little bit of bruising i would say that you should continue to take the aspirin okay ? cause it will reduce your risk of heart disease okay so no numbness tingling or weakness ?
no history of anxiety depression
nothing along those lines ? okay alright so now you being an np what ah screening tests should you have ? you know about the mammogram we talked about that mm hmm it s about time for a colonoscopy again yes it is and um bone density um i d love to have one they tried to get me approved for one at age and hap said not till so i don't know if you know yeah you know if you have some specific risk factors that would ah predispose you toward it like being on steroids for an example then ah it would get done earlier but if you don t have any of those risk factors then you don t really have to have it earlier now we re finding that some insurances will allow you to do it early but really the screening guidelines say for folks of average risk and if you exercise and by the way i want you to exercise more at least three times a week get that heart rate up for at least minutes so you know that ah the fact that you re a minority meaning not ah you know a caucasian you re not as at greater risk ah in the fact that you exercise also you don t drink a lot of alcohol so there are a lot of things that ah mean that you are at less risk but if hap will pay for it at then we can order it at okay
okay um so the main screening tests then for you are really the mammogram and the colonoscopy i m sure you re up to date on your your ah vaccinations i m looking here i see tetanus flu shot of course ppd s which we re all kind of required to get okay so and looking at your weight pounds sure you could you could probably be pounds ah lighter and as you know these calculations for what ah it determines if a person is overweight or not at your bmi is just above what s considered ideal and it has to do with survival ah what we know is that people who are at at a healthy weight tend to live longer okay but having said that you know i think just a little bit of exercise and a little bit of tweaking of the diet it sounds like overall it s pretty good and you ll be right there okay so i don t see anything at all that s very concerning your blood pressure is very good today it s below the threshold that reduces your risk of heart disease so usually i ll say to my patients who have blood pressure problems come see me twice a year but given that you re a nurse practitioner in the system you can check your blood pressure and everything looks so good um i would think just an annual then for you is just fine how does that sound ?
it sounds good
okay now let s go over the um gynecologic history and we ll take care of that um how many pregnancies ? and how many children ? okay all term vaginally or you have a c section ? one c section okay any history of abnormal paps smears ? um yes there was right after my daughter was born so okay so awhile ago how often have you been getting your paps smears ? yearly ? okay married ? divorced are you sexually active ?
and you haven t been for how long ? three years
three years okay and but you ve been getting yearly paps smears ? and the last two have been normal ? actually since um since the years ago they ve been normal well you know if or the reason i ask with respect to your sexual activity if you haven t been active for three years you ve been getting these yearly paps smears and they re normal you don t actually have to have a paps smear this year how do you feel about that ? now i ll do it if you want me to no i m good i m i m fine i mean i i am happy when my doctor says oh okay good mm hmm yes yes and i wondered about that with my because i m not sexually active right the the guidelines are if you re not sexually active and you ve had at least a couple of paps smears and you ve not had any recent history of an abnormal one then we can start to skip okay ? alright so you could get a paps smear next year
okay alright so let s look at blood work then ah which looks ah good from last year in july actually you had a bunch of things drawn last year um including a cholesterol profile which looked pretty darn good thyroid level was normal and those don t have to be checked yearly by the way um did you fast today though ? i did not okay alright so i thought i might take the form with me and right okay um well we don t have to technically speaking we don t have to do that ah fasting lipid profile we could do a non fasting but if you re going to take the form with you we ll let you the vitamin b i noticed that level was pretty high mm hmm yeah um is is that vitamin b is a water soluble right ? so it s i should have to worry about that or ? no no yeah cause i do take b complex every day and i take a multi vitamin yeah yeah no you don t have to worry about toxicity in that situation okay alright okay ? okay so what we ll do is i see you do have a slightly low y count here i ll bet this is kind of well it looks like it s sort of up and down so what we ll do is we ll repeat a blood count on you we ll go ahead and repeat the electrolytes again for you the the ah lipid profile we ll go ahead and do that since you re going to get your blood work drawn okay ? um and we ll give you we ll give you a referral to colonoscopy and mammogram ah and it looks like you re up to date on all your vaccinations can you think of any questions ?
i do have one question
there is an area of concern um and it s a growth and i don t i will you take a look at it ? yes i will i i hope that i can find it it s very small or is it just something where you sort of healed and that there s something there mm hmm and you can t really see something i can see it a little bit yeah um what you can get sometimes right here is irritation of the hair follicles and you can get all the ah various benign skin nodules here that you get every place else okay so you think so just looking here i i would not worry about that at all no ? okay cause i ve used it s reoccurred over over time like over a few years mm hmm and i ve used like a wart remover mm hmm and i wondered but i know that i have you know a lot of little growths and right and these are all and i don't know if it s the same as this or not yeah and just inspecting here this is not anything if you re wondering about sexually transmitted at all okay i just needed your opinion on that unfortunately you know with the skin you can get differ various kinds of scarring most of it is benign now um being a person of color do you need a skin survey ? you know a dermatologic skin survey ? um you re not as at risk like people who are fair skinned are but you know it would behoove you to maybe go over and and they would tell you how frequently a skin survey is a good idea for you okay ? so i ll give you that referral can you think of any other questions ? nope you ve answered everything okay alright well it s a pleasure to meet you oh the pleasure s mine thank you so much
you re welcome and let me just double check here the one thing we didn t do is the medications here so that s your b complex your fish oil the flonase you use as needed and you re just taking the hydrochlorothiazide once a day and you know my gfr dropped last time so i cut that to half okay so you re taking milligrams alright ah and then the levsin you aren t really using this or you are ? i am as needed ? as needed but you re not using it now ? and i d like a refill and you need a refill on that ? actually i need a refill on everything because um okay you get this one over the counter ? yes over the counter okay alright just the um the levsin the and the hydrochlorothiazide the flonase ? mm hmm and the toprol and the toprol ? mm hmm o you don t those are oh and the and the ah potassium please okay and the potassium okay so refill that one refill that one the you re not taking ? the toprol xl you are ? and that s the correct dose ? okay and these are going where ? um to new center one please okay and this is something over the counter that you re using as well ? make sure you put that in okay what is this ? oh it s just saying two times two tablets once a day oh thank you two plus one b per day meal okay we ll get these ah prescriptions sent over for you you go ahead and get dressed and we ll give you this to take with you so you can get your blood drawn
thank you so much thank you you re welcome alright you can go ahead and get dressed have a good day you too thank you for allowing me
well we have physical to do in minus one minute well you know what i m i m not going to hold you to that physical i can t do that to you well how are we going to do this because i want to be able to do you want to sit here instead ? okay you want she can sit over here then she she s on her own right i m fine i m fine doesn t matter okay good thank you when i m thinking i had my ekg this morning and not in time for pap i don t need that the only thing i really need is a breast exam and you know the diabetic thing is more important that s more important that s the most important thing anyway i agree yeah
and i got news from dr f this morning he took me off of uh coumadin really ? said my ekg is back to normal and i he said so there s no reason for you to be on it and i said well what if it goes back again he says well he says that had nothing with you having that heart flutter has nothing to do with you taking coumadin or not taking coumadin my eyes have been dialated so if i look funny to you because i m looking funny at you i am you had a lot done today and so he says it was just that if anything were to happen that it would help you with your your blood not to clot he said but you re not having any fluttering any more so i m real happy that that flutter is gone now did you can you tell when it comes back ? had you had any sense of it ? that s what i asked him i never felt i never felt anything the only thing i ve been feeling and still feeling and i owe it some i think to the medication is this feeling of not being able to focus my eyes and feeling like my head is spinning which medication do you think it is ? well i think that my blood pressure medication is the worst of it is what i think and then i think that the coumadin has something to do with it also but i don t know if the does or not but that blood pressure medication is the worst and dr r i ve had trouble being able to take blood pressure medication for years so which so tell me do you check your blood pressure at home too d ? mm mm because i m looking and seeing what we have for yeah this morning there it was over now she said she got over ? so at home you measure it ? well this was done done by dr dr f this morning at cardiology ? okay okay so um
alright so let s go back for a minute because we re kind of organizing what we re going to do today you ve written a lot of this out for me and i don t have his report but what you re telling me is that he s saying you no longer have to be on coumadin
and one of so that s you re happy about ? one of the things that you re concerned about is that you have this head swimming thing that you must have had since the last time i saw you huh ? it hasn t changed ? i ve had i ve had it for ever since i ve been taking medication any medication ? no the blood pressure medication and it also makes me feel sick but i kind of got over that uh huh because they divided that in half take milligrams in the morning and at night so that s the one you think is doing it ? that s that ? well the only reason why i think it s doing it is like i said it s because i ve had trouble with all of them at least from from dr s when she was my doctor uh huh huh huh we had trouble with that so i so you re on the water pill though too right ? no dr f mentioned to me this morning that i might have an inner ear problem mm hmm he says if you re having that feeling of of that your head is swimming or you don t want you can t focus your eyes because i notice a difference if i m a bad girl and don t take my medication which i ve done and i felt great you know it could have been a pyschy thing too i don t know but but anyway or if it s actually really that causing it you know ? i um if you ve ever had your eyes dialated you get that feeling you can see but they don t want to focus uh huh that s how i feel during the day most of the day and you don t know whether it s the water pill or the ? but i think it s the you do ? i do okay alright and then you re on the too ? no ? but i don t take that every day that s not daily okay i don t take it every day just take it with my allergies okay so then we so we have that sensation which you ve been putting up with okay we have your blood pressure we have the fact that you have the arrhythmia and that s better okay and we have your diabetes right ? which i brought my machine for you to check
then we have is there anything else that you wanted to make sure we covered you said you need your breast exam ? yes she gave me a mammogram request already but i don t know if you still have to a manual one or not uh yeah absolutely okay i wasn t it s all part of the big deal i wasn t positive
okay and then as we look at what else you need to have done we ve got this little stop light remember ? and so let s look and see what else and i have a feeling that since we have is it t ? now you get k bear with us we better talk about your blood and your colon
you had suggested you look so terrific i m glad things are going well for you are either of your boys married yet ? oh no oh good no no that s my phone i thought i turned it off
is it we re going to ignore it okay um so they okay so let s let s like keep on task here because you go away and i don t see you for months and months i haven t i i know and i got into that my health program though and i m waiting to get the feedback on that so you and i can go back and forth on that i don t have a computer but i do have a library where wherever i go wherever i am uh huh where you can go back into it yeah because i haven t seen you for a year i haven t been around for a year well i was i was back here a couple of times yeah yeah once for funeral and
okay and i m looking at your lab tests from when we did see did you had some lab tests done also i got that request and i m thinking that some of them were doubled this morning there it is and this was from july and that was something that is worrisome because it s way too high and so i wanted to focus in on your sugars again
and then what about getting when was your last colonoscopy ? or your last i ve never had one doctor never had one oh so how why tell me how you think about that ? the girl that was teaching everybody else you got to have this and mmmmm right you certainly know all the things i could say don t you ? oh i do i absolutely do i know the rules i ll do it next time i come i ll call you will ? so does that mean you ll make the appointment on your way out today ? for a colonoscopy ? mm hmm make the appointment well what i m going to do i have a little connection over there still so so i m going to try and make so that i can make my appointment because you have to be evaluated first and then not always not always ? mm mm especially if you re off coumadin you may not have to be for a colonoscopy really ? yeah yeah you fill out this little form here and they kind of notice what s going on and they check especially since and then uh if i can pull a little favor here or there maybe i can get it if i do have to be evaluated first get them both done in the same week or in the same few days you know could try it right you could try that but and i would right so you re really committed to doing that uh ? no i m just trying to think that i m going to alright well let s let s think about what you re really saying to yourself i ve been through a lot of them with my father with a friend uh huh uh huh right and and let s see your mom had ovarian cancer right is that or did she have colon what you know when my worst my worst on that on that thing what ? is dying on the table from that thing tell me about that tell me what you mean why ? well isn t it isn t it isn t it true that there is uh a vein a main vein that runs right into the anal opening and you can have a heart attack if the exam goes wrong with the with the colonoscopy ? i think that s part of a myth oh it is part of a myth ? but what i m hearing the uh thing that might come closest with that is that people s blood their pulse might slow down it s the nerve oh is that where it is ? and so that s really not that only if you re ready to have a heart attack and some you would ve had it anyway i see would that be ? oh is that the case ? i think you re like kind of mixing up stories yeah i am i m glad yeah right right well we you know years ago dr s was doing a sigmoid when it happened you remember that ? no i don t i wasn t there for that visit oh because i did and i was part of that emergency team that ran the stuff down there oh dear well no wonder you got scared well sure you know it s one of those things you know it s in your mind and you don t forget it right i believe that so that would be something i could probably just say uh oh he that was not it was in bad timing my my sphincter muscle is very tight from the time i was a child although i have regular bowel movements and i ve never had a problem i worry about that too the pain mm hmm you know that s actually pretty easy to take care of because you re in some sedation and they have would they put me out ? if oh yeah they would ? absolutely all you have to do close your eyes and you go out oh that would be great it s a very comfortable sedation i had a lady here last week she said to me i have never had such a good sleep she was she was really amazing i said you should be here all the time to talk to my patients talk yeah because it s definitely something that is very easy to do once you get once you know that its going to happen and you do it and they make you feel like you re clean like you re at a spa really ? yeah yeah where at ? at downtown or at lakeside ? at lakeside or at west bloomfield dr s is wonderful dr l is wonderful they yeah we have excellent teams that do this they keep you warm there s no pain involved really and truthfully the narrowness of the scope is like this you have bowel movements that are wider than this yeah but they re that s wider than this i know it s wider than that your bowel movements are wider than this is what i m saying oh yeah they are that s true but that s coming out isn t it you don t know the difference yes you do you can t tell hat s true yeah my next trip in though i i know i need to do that because i m years past due she s got my wrong age on here too but i m years overdue let me see i know it s recommended to have it at
and how old are you ? ? oh you re right she really gave you a nice and she sure did few years that s wonderful wouldn t mind going back years yeah i think that would be great so let s have you do that i m going to um go back years ? uh yeah let s do that let s see then i wouldn t be on all this medication
you have been in well you ll be off the coumadin see that s another advantage if you can do it while you re off this coumadin i think that would be great
if you have time i going to have uh questions for you what else ? that weight watchers program that they have do i have to get a written requisition from you ? i don t think so hap is supposed to pay for it and we pay for it ? right yeah people are just going they just go right to weight watchers and sign up ? mm hmm well i ve never been for a weight watchers because i i need more cleansing of the mind then anything i don t need to weighed in by somebody i need to be talked to and my hand slapped i mean like this you know i don t think they ll slap you no they won t that s what i feel that i need but maybe you could do both but maybe i can find something there to help m but it will give a pattern absolutely maybe i can do that they ll give you absolutely a healthy pattern i think that s a fabulous thing fabulous thing that would be great so that s
and the other question okay what else ? uh the handicap parking permit which i have had now do i have to get that paper work renewed from you every year or just go to the state and have it done ? i think it has to come from me it has to come you too every year every years ? i don t know i don t know if it s a year thing or i think what did you what did it say ? did it say permit ? it s it s a permanent it s a permanent sticker then if it was permanent i d think you can you know like just be able to get it done who did it come from ? what what category are we talking about here ? uh you mean why i have it ? uh huh okay from uh my i fell here back years ago on ice so actually we re thinking between the knee and the back mm hmm so it s orthopedic ? mm hmm well i guess you could say orthopedic i don t know yeah sure i ve never been to orthopedics for it but that s what it was now there s sometimes i don t need it but there re sometimes that i do you know you had mentioned that i had arthritis in my back mm hmm and i can t walk far it s like i get so fatigued and when my back is fatigued like i can t stand up any more you know so i try to walk every day but i know getting the weight off would definitely help it sure would that would be important and i know it s what i got to do could you write me out a sticker i ll pay through work anyway in case i do need it because i m up for renewal well i d have to prove that i evaluated you for that so that s one of the things that we have to do even though you did it before ? yeah because things change over time oh golly mm hmm so okay you don t have time for that today ? i m i m afraid that we re going to have to uh i i would prefer that we focus on the diabetes because i think that that s more of a threat to you um and i can give you a temporary uh i should probably watch you walk and maybe give you a referral to an orthopedist who could confirm it for us because they may be able to provide you with something that you haven t had before maybe some training things that you can do when you re home to help you with that or it might be something simple that they could offer okay well for about years mm hmm you know and uh it s pain in the right knee is that it ? the right knee and the back ? well actually both of my knees my right is worse it s not my knee it s the surrounding area but i fell on my knees they went numb you know and then uh my back has been a problem and like you said you had diagnosed that one time as far as being arthritic and that was probably my problem to go with that yeah arthritis it takes all forms so we d have to document something a little bit more than just that like use a specialist to document what s going on and for them to talk about what you can and can t do fell years ago well my license plate renewal is up and that it too so i thought i would just kill birds with one stone and get it all done handicap parking okay and your hips too ? or not so much ? your back ? back yes i mean there s some days i need a cane by my bedside you know you do you re using a cane ? oh but you know that well i can give you something for at least six months until you can get back here i m taking that quinine water that you had suggested and it does help with the it does help okay now can i take more than a glass a day ? i can do like glasses or ? mm hmm mm hmm i find it very thirst quenching and it s um i don t drink pop any more except on a rare occasion good that that s got sugar in it unless you get the unsweetened i got the diet yeah but i find it very thirst quenching because it s not sweet yeah you could take it a couple a day it should be okay
but it should be sugarless so so where s your monitor ? let s take a look at that because we re going to and so i m going to fill out this form for your colon too okay
you re going to fill out the form for my the colonoscopy oh okay mm hmm now how do i might take it home and frame it okay are you going to take an aspirin a day ? did dr f say that ? he didn t tell that but yes i am going to coated aspirin they re going to have you stop taking it i m happy to because i want to tell you something i take an aspirin a lot of my pains go away for the day that s good make sure it s coated okay make sure it s a coated aspirin ? uh huh
and did he say you had or did he say you had ? no he said i had a flutter but it s no longer there and i have a copy of the ekg in the car i thought it might be in the computer and i didn t bring it in for you and i m sorry i stuck it in between a magazine that i had gotten and dr r i have to tell you i m not too much better at taking my blood sugars four or six times a day and some days i oh i think that s a lot to take there s some days i do and some days i only take it once or twice now if that s some mental thing and still in denial i don t know but i m bad no i think that s okay just tell me how you give yourself your medicine how do you know how much to give ? okay uh you re talking about in between meals ? uh huh when i don t take it ? um well i have to give myself two units anyway and if i had don t have my machine with me if i m having something i m usually guessing my blood sugars are never very rarely under very rarely now the last week you re going to find i m under that yeah but they re very rarely under so i know i have to take two units and then i kind of what i ve been kind of going by is what i m going to be eating okay some people do that that s alright and that s okay ? mm hmm and sometimes there s been times where my blood sugar was and i know i should be taking four units i ll sometimes even give myself you know the full four instead of just maybe the three it s supposed to be uh one unit for every points over i ll give myself that extra one because i think well i m going to have this anyway so it s going to utilize it so you go by what you re eating ? now this is where the they practice so that for every additional grams of carbohydrates oh okay and you give yourself another unit the to grams so you give a little carbohydrate book too carry it with you if you don t have your machine and figure it out from there yep exactly exactly right because i m still bad about eating bread and i m still bad about rice and potatoes okay well that s where yeah. well those are my biggest weaknesses and chips
and i think that your the weight watchers that you that you say you re going to do will be helpful with that chips rice potatoes bread okay okay let s see let me look at dr what s your weight from your last visit here ? but i don t even see you know that the last time i saw you she said one test was done from today i guess the urine analysis okay you re down about a about four eight no no you re exactly the same kilograms you re down about a pound okay okay and i m seeing numbers on here that are well it looks like you run often in a high s and sometimes up to the mid s does that sound about right ?
well i ve had an occasional up into there and like i told you i ve been very bad at myself for even taking this like three or four times a day and not only take it once or twice so yes but you know those are the times i cheated i m talking about a real brownie or a real piece of bread i mean a real real piece of uh candy or something uh huh and i do do that chips and that s then it goes where ? i mean i don t just get a small bag of chips cent bag and eat it well i have to i ve got to be honest with you okay you do i do have to be honest with you i can t i don t want you to do something here that is not true you know so so what i m trying to get though is that you take two units plus so you re giving yourself averages in the day of how much insulin ? i would say probably what s a typical day ? uh to units a day to units of ? i would say so okay and then units once a day okay and so and then still your blood sugars run around what ? well my fastings they re all running around s and up i had a couple of low ones last week but i mean how high ? but it looks like they re running in the s to you re telling me yeah yep yep yep yep and up to uh what did i see like s i had called you at that one point and you were good enough to call me back when i had that real funny spell uh huh breaking out in in sweats that one day so you dropped down there so so i m wondering if you are better off if you go into three units now let s just try getting you up to three units going to what ? take tree units before each meal when you say this is a flex pen is this your ? yes you can make do you want to see it ? is it or is it just ? good okay insulin that s good okay yeah it s a real neat little thing alright so you re getting your blood no this is perfect and you just dial it perfect good so i think that if you start to count carbs d that s going to be a direction we can go in using insulin i mean it doesn t free you to eat as many carbs because you ll gain weight okay ? it takes that sugar and it just puts it right into your cells but if you ve got to i d rather have you have the normal blood sugars okay ?
and then work with the weight watchers to drop the weight you re going to have to kind of get a sense of that now you talked about your anxiety and your nervous and depression kinds of things and i think that that s something you need to see somebody for my life my life s not going in the direction it was supposed to go in to i ve lost all of my retirement program and i ve just and stuck into places where i don t want to be stuck into do you have a place to live ? oh yeah right now i how did you know i almost didn t ? i know that we talked about that mm hmm and then for last year on this other medication there was lot of foods i couldn t eat either you may have to reset this for the time and an alarm i started to point push things and i think i set an alarm for you alright now let s make sure that what we ve think you re on
so now i can go back on i don t have to worry about not eating too much creams or that other stuff so it s a good time to go on the weight watchers so that s an advantage yeah so now i can eat any vegetable i want and you off the coumadin you re saying ? and he said that today and i m going to get that note but okay so while you re i really want you to sneak in this um um additional testing that we got come on back and let s get you under control here can i at least give you the cards to check for your stool ? send the stools cards in ?
of course of course alright let s do it alright and you did the last one when i here too fruit is another thing dr r did you send them in ? fruit is another weakness i ve got that i have to learn to control too alright cut it up first don t eat a whole you know don t have a whole one there alright let me examine you she knows
yeah of course of course mammogram colonoscopy you had some labs done did i just do ? okay good you had been and when you were here you were so remember we celebrated that for my ? so it went down five five tenths of a point ? yeah a half of a gram yeah well that s good
and but your cholesterol needed to be improved it was well you know i started eating more meat but of course i i didn t i do do lean meats i don t eat uh lunch meat and stuff like that uh huh but um i try to get more protein into my diet and get rid of the carbs well i think you re if you can do it with vegetables that would be great because even extra protein isn t always so
i m not going be able to get up with my with your knee i m seeing how you re or with my with my my hip i can t walk up and down stairs i can t walk up and down stairs any more excuse us k it s just like everything just went all at once it was about four years ago five years ago if i don t have a railing you can forget it because of your back your hip ? for an old lady
take a deep breath can i undo your bra oh sure want me to do it undo it or ? okay lie yourself back here there wasn t going to be another here let me i m okay like that but um i got so bad dr r i was on the plane yesterday is that going to be okay ? i just want to do the breast exam did you get my bra off ? that s what i just did i just undid it that s what i just did okay ? get my arm up boy am i warm eh ?
no so i wish we had more time here i m sorry about that i should have asked i should have called back and i called back and reconfirmed all my reservations you got a lot done today though didn t you ? you saw dr you always get a lot done okay well i m glad to see you you did ? well i m done with you i ll go get the handicap work for you okay ? and we ll see how you can put yourself all together and we ll see how you do
okay so as far as um the charley horses i should just stay on the quinine ? i think the yes and if you can do anything like moving weight wise and exercise wise that s going to help the blood test might tell me if there s a um uh electrolyte imbalance or if there s something going on with that okay ? i think we we tested that last year too we did that so that s good
i m going to have to say good bye good luck to you thank you dr r i ll be in again soon i hope so i m putting down months so i ll see what you can manage okay alright let s see what we can do thank you i think i better put my bra back on oh my prescriptions am i to get those from you ? um how many do you need ? that was good how many do you need ? i need um the needles for the flex pen did you tell did she put them all in ? and the needles for the yeah she put in all of this didn t she ? the you got it you got it covered then we ll do them all and you want me to send them to walgreens on olive boulevard ? that would be fine because like where ever i am at i can call a walgreen and get it there i don t particularly care for their service except for that okay so there it goes they don t seem to be bothered by transfers and all that good deal okay thank you dr r you re welcome d take good care

mm hmm and the numbness and the swelling i i think that s been occurring before the accident correct ? yeah yeah but after i broke this toe it it seemed like it s much more the toe don t go down at all but it i m always on my feet so correct right and are you wearing special shoes though when you re at work though ? uh yeah i i well i had after i broke my toe i tried to find you know it was difficult for me to find shoes i had to find those ones with the back out and so far i ve been wearing those i don t wear these kind at work right right you know i just uh yeah i think these are too narrow and so i don t wear these kind i i try to keep the kind that um that s wide you know open toe yeah yeah high toe box and things like that and yeah and then i got some reeboks but they they were kind of narrow so i can t wear those they bother my feet that s right so but and then you re not allowed to wear sandals can you at all ? can t wear yeah yeah can t wear sandals correct right so but you know this is what i m talking about you see how that s swollen right there ? mm hmm yeah right on that toe there and and see right up under here ? and then on that side too ? sure yeah it it feels like you know blood or something getting there mm hmm you know what i m saying ? you see how my feet look those spots ? do you see any discoloration at all though ? i don t see no discoloration i just see these spots i don t know whether they re from age or from poor blood circulation or what but i try to get the right kind of shoe right size shoe i need to look at the other foot too you know and um i don t know they this used to didn t bother me and now it s bothering me but you re having the symptoms on both feet though right ? i mean yeah this one is not as bad not as bad okay but that one is really bad that one is you know but sometimes that s the foot that you injured and fractured your your foot there your toe but sometimes both of them will be swollen be numb and and mm hmm like you know like it s sort of like um needle pains shooting through them right right and the needle pains you say it s in the toe does it does it travel up anywhere else like on the back or your leg or up this way ? like sometime it it ll the pain ll get to the point where it s like um it almost feel like electricity mm hmm ou know what i m saying ? yeah does it travel up though do you notice ? yeah it it like it travels from here from my toes does it ? up here sometimes all the way up okay okay sometimes yeah mm hmm sometimes it feels like something crawling that s not there you know what i m saying ? i don t know whether it s a medical condition i m just telling you how it feels sometimes right and i m glad you re telling me these things so we can investigate and see what s going on okay ? and uh and yeah and of course that s concern of you because you know it bothers you when you can t work properly and things so yeah it it bothers my we ll look into that it s beginning to bother my feet to the point where i really had to mention it but um sure is there any swelling right now ? no just on that toe you know but it s going to stay swollen if i m on it that s right other than that i don t it just feels like when this happens when this this um when my toes start bothering me it just feels like a big old clump of meat is up under here right up under there uh huh yeah it feels different doesn t it ? yeah it just feels different right okay and sometimes it gets to the point where i can t you know i have to get up off my feet because right right it it has me limping right i m going to look at the x ray of the foot there and see what we uh can further investigate about this okay ? alright ? but other than that have you tried taking medication to see if it may ease the pain and the swelling that feeling and things like that ? um yeah you know i tried the uh i well i would take tylenol sometimes right uh huh um and then i tried the excedrin that didn t work mm hmm okay um and then you know you had gave me some motrins you know for my back and stuff and mm hmm right did that help ?

no ? okay and the last time you did your mammogram was one year ago so you are due for another one this year so i will give you that request to do the mammogram now on the paper there is a list of different areas where you can do your mammogram plus its telephone number and the hours and so oh okay you find the one that s convenient for you to do your mammogram and your pap smear how about your pap smear ? that was last year wasn t it ? yeah i did that for you that was in november so we ll need to come back in november to do it for you
alright ? now are you still having your period or ? no it when did it stop ? oh it stopped when i was about forty seven and you have not had any bleeding since then ? no bleeding any vaginal itch or discharge ?
no ? okay good so when we finish we ll make an appointment for you to come back to do your pap smear okay ? and we need to do it on the anniversary date of your last pap smear if we try to do it before then your insurance will charge you for that okay ? so we don t want to do that no we don t want to do that right unless there s some problem then of course you know we we d have you checked out for that other problem mm hmm
okay and i m going to press on your stomach and you tell me if there s any pain anywhere okay ? and your heart sounds nice and regular very good no problem ? okay sometimes when i take those pills it does that yes that s right okay now i m going to feel your leg here no pain here when i m touching here at all ? no ? uh uh
okay have you noticed any swelling here in the legs ? i don t see any swelling in the ankle but i do see swelling across the toes here especially this big toe your left one where you had the fracture yes i do see the swelling there is there any pain when i m touching there ? no it s not in pain when you re touching no ? but it feels like it s you know it feels numb it feels like um it does i don t know the only word i can come up with it feels like it s being shocked you know mm hmm electricity it might have i might have touched some electricity or something that s what it feels like okay let me see well i m going to test the feeling on your toes here okay ? with this stick here and i m feeling on your arm right now that s sharp huh ? mm hmm yeah sharp ? here too ? mm hmm sharp ? okay i m going to touch down here you tell me if it feels the same if i touch here compared to your arm it feels different okay so this is sharp ? mm hmm this is sharper though ? no this is this is like just i can barely feel that okay so so you feel something but it s not sharp ? i feel something yeah okay how about over here ? yeah i feel something mm hmm if i touch you here this is sharp ? mm hmm and then over here ? i feel the sharpness there okay how about over here ? no ? how about over here ? a little i feel a how about here ? yeah i feel that mm hmm how about this ? i feel it uh huh and how about that ? so again this is sharp ? mm hmm how does this feel ? feels dull now dull okay so i noticed that there is some uh change of that sensation here here and here too okay ? um you may have a pinched nerve here i think you may you may okay because if you curl up your toes curl up your toes like that yeah this one too good press down on my finger press press good this one press you ve got good strength there mm hmm alright ? do you feel weak in the in the feet or toes ? like when you re pressing on the gas pedal does it feel weak at all ? no it doesn t feel weak mm hmm just sometimes it feels like it gets to the point where i have to you know sit down the pain is so intense sometimes i have to take my shoe off you know and and try to see if i can t get some feeling back into it okay alright i m going to touch you across the bottom foot how s that feel ? i feel that ? how about here ? yep i feel that now i m going to have you stand up for me and i want you to walk for me i want to see how you walk okay ? okay okay you want me to walk ? mm hmm walk in a straight line yeah how does that feel ? it feels like i m walking on a piece of maybe a piece of cotton or something is up under my foot mm hmm mm hmm can you on both of them can you walk on your toes for me ? yeah mm hmm okay walk on your heels for me how s that ? that s okay yeah you look good okay good mm hmm i don t know maybe it s just i don t know what it is i i i think it may be more of like a pinched nerve somewhere oh okay and and let s investigate this okay ? and that would involve doing it s called electromyograph test mm hmm where um they would put needles along the nerves traveling down the legs to see if there is any kind of nerve damage if there s a nerve being pinched off somewhere or a nerve damage from maybe medication or diabetes or a pinched nerve in the back or something like that okay ? so let s investigate that and that could be explaining why you have the different feeling um on on your feet um to treat that kind of condition we have to use a different kind of medication other than that motrin and things like that okay ? and and the medication i m thinking of giving you is called gabapentin alright ? mm hmm and uh and we ll start off with a small amount okay ? and we ll just maybe take one time see how it goes okay ? side effects from that is that it can make you kind of sleepy mm hmm maybe in the beginning because you re starting to take the medicine first it may cause you a little nausea a little dizziness but i d like you to keep taking it for a couple more days until it gets settled in your body and that that should help you with the pain and this abnormal feeling in your feet alright ? okay so we ll just take one at that time and see how it goes um but i can take it like at i get off from work at i usually don t lay down until about mm hmm so i can take it like sure you can take it like that okay okay i m hoping that it won t make you feel dizzy or feel kind of drowsy the next day if it does you know give me a call we ll discuss how we can adjust the medication okay that s fine and if it doesn t work we can try something different okay ? that s fine
okay do you need any other medications right now ? anything else right now ? i don t think so i i i m trying to remember the the um from my uh huh i don t know whether i need any more okay i ll i ll look in the chart here i might not need anymore you may not need any more and and again this is very small i mean i don t um if it s not it s the it doesn t size of a like like a half a dollar or quarter and and it s kind of a little deep so you may have a little nodule there yes we can watch it we i could send you to a surgeon and he could take it out for you but no i i don t want to a scar though you know and no it s not bothering me like that i just thought i d bring it to your attention you know sure okay because i didn t know you know right right right but i do feel it yeah you do have something there okay ?

excuse how are you doing ? i ll be are we doing cultures and um take a look at it mm hmm check check the breasts first oh wrong arm
um no a little tenderness where that thing was but um nothing ever changed come on
push a little bit yeah that s the back part coming down it looks like oh can that be just taken off ? is it something i need ? that s that s your rectum let me just see here now push push you re still coming down a little bit in the front mm hmm i think that s my now push a little bit yeah that s your rectum i think coming out yeah push again yeah that s coming from the back mm hmm you can push up and that s the bladder ? no that s the back the bladder s in the front oh okay and it s still coming down they they the bladder is not like it was it s not falling like it was now the problem is is the rectum you have a rectocele uh huh that s what you have before it was a cystocele vaginal prolapse with a cystocele now you ve got a rectocele how d that happen ? well it s everything it got loose everything was loose and i think that it is the more prominent thing now i mean it was probably there all the time and it s just that it wasn t it was being overshadowed by the by the other other stuff okay oh so that that s coming down is that s popping out now is the rectum your rectum the posterior vaginal wall okay and before your uterus was coming down like that and the bladder was coming as well oh okay from the front now this part is coming in that s what s going on now and uh let s see what they look up on the internet about rectoceles okay my mom had one uh huh she had to go in did they repair hers ? was she satisfied with it ? yeah she hasn t had any complaints about it uh huh um is it a different type of repair ? because in the hospital you know i don t i m not sure don t know i imagine the it s kind of a similar kind of thing mm hmm um and exactly what all they do i m not sure but everything is kind of loose in there but they ve got the front part you know it it pooches a little bit but it doesn t fall out okay ? but it s that back part because i m holding the bladder up and that comes right back behind my finger there anyway yeah right came right uh i was holding up the front part just to make sure it wasn t that and then the the back part came tumbling out okay ? that s probably why that pessory is not it s not working well the it s only holding the front part and the back is still pushing it s the back part right it s the it s the back part and that s the pressure that i feel down there but without it i m i m just so uncomfortable i d rather i right now i m putting it in there i ll find out what she tells me wednesday but um i got to have something i got to work all day and i can t the way it feels hanging there is just mm hmm i i can t even describe that to you it s like it s not right it feels all dry and i remember you telling me once before that you know one of the reasons for the repair was so that there s no infection and mm hmm because this is something that shouldn t be outside it should be inside right it should be you know it s like exposing your tongue to the air all the time you you don t want your tongue dry you know that s right that s right oh boy i just hope it s not as extensive as that the surgery i just had done was it painful ? um it wasn t really the fact that it was painful i had to wear a um catheter for a week this is the back i know so the i m hoping this is easier so you just have well you have a a rectal catheter oh god no i m just kidding don t do me like that doctor please oh that s the that was the worst part of it eah i don t know what they they use was that catheter for a week it s horrible but once that was removed you know and i i stayed off work as long as i was supposed to but so obviously the front healed okay it s pretty much it s that back part that s now pushing everything else mm hmm right boy can the part that s hanging out do i need that ? they got to push that back get that back up in there or is that something they could take get rid of and just ? i m not i m not sure you want to get rid of it because it may it may um choke off the outflow of of stool your stool has to come out of is is it hard to move your bowels now ? it s not hard ? uh uh uh huh uh uh i use um i guess i make sure i i get some do you do you get big bowel movements ? you can ? yeah they re sizable mm hmm yep and i do a lot of fiber to make sure it continues so i m in the natural stuff doctor as much as i can i d like for you if you would write down what s going on what we think s going on with my knee i want to read up on it
it it s we re going to x ray it s just it s arthritis is that it ? arthritis will make you swell like that ? that s what happens that s what well it s arthritis and it has led to crunch ? everything that i described it leads to which is the cartilage getting rubbing against the no fluid it sounds like and mm hmm that will crunch that s normal yes yes that s crunch and grind yours hopefully isn t that bad okay ? i hope not you got the cartilage wearing out so it s no longer smooth and glistening and everything else is a result of that the of fluid the loss of full extension the loss of full the the knee or the muscle getting a little smaller because you re favoring it okay ? okay and if i keep working on it then um the muscle may like that you know without holding weight you know without bringing you hold it for ten seconds and then relax and then tighten because i have been kind of careful with it right and you pull on you don t pull because i i didn t know stairs with it like you do the other one you ?
atrophy is setting in is that what s going on ? well mild it s very mild it ain t real real bad so rectocele so there may be something i can do with this because i i don t like i need to go back to swimming that s always been a good exercise for me i just haven t done it in a while we ll xerox that for you okay ? okay thank you and you can read about it rectum and vagina become weakened along the front wall of the rectum to bulge into the vagina that s exactly what s happening tissue in your vagina that may or may not protrude through the vaginal opening mm hmm rectum is not completely empty after bowel movement difficulty controlling and passing stool okay let s keep going down this what they what they do surgically let s see tests and diet treatments and drugs prevention so treatments pessory yeah that s surgery is especially bothering you mm hmm you may opt for surgery more commonly your doctor may suggest surgery such as a cystocele mm hmm mm hmm that s what they did with the front okay alright so uh i ll give you that literature and you re going to go get an x ray of your um while you re waiting you can read okay okay uh my doctor was sincere i strongly agree get rid of that hey ! okay yeah i have a few questions about the information you gave me to read too did you want me to set that down ? thank you mm hmm want to go this first or ? um i noticed that in part of this explanation about the rapid urge sometimes after i think i ve gone already mm hmm and i get up i do sometimes feel like it s not quite finished yet because it s kinked the rectum is rectum straight and and that aids in evacuation if you got a straight rectum you can dump but if there s a kink in there which is what you have and especially when you were bearing down to have a bowel movement mm hmm that s that s when it s actually developing the kink and it s falling out through the vagina so yeah it s going to give you exactly okay oh yeah what they re describing um the defecagram ? it s an x ray ? uh huh how s that done ? do i have to drink some stuff or ? hmm um i m pretty sure they put it up in the rectum and have you retain it and then see how it comes out mm hmm okay you know anything much about that ? hmm no um the question is who handles that ? i m i m not sure if the colon and rectal handles that or whether uh let s say we see colon oh you re going to see gyn ? i m going to see gyn but did suggest that colon and rectal ? let s have you that i do both let s give you an appointment with colon and rectal to have them evaluate you after you see them okay ? and you can get two opinions that sounds good um management that doesn t seem like it s a problem i do i have regular mm hmm every morning but i do trail mix salads so i m i m doing my fiber i got to beef up on the glass i mean the glass the fluids my water because it s talking about how the fiber s a sponge and what have you mm hmm my pessory is it causing harm for me to use it improperly or ? she ll probably tell me next week but for right now that s all i have are you more comfortable with it than you or without it ? if i m going shopping or going to walk around yeah you re more well i would say that it s it s okay it causes discomfort in my abdomen because of it hitting on something i think it s like the muscles mm hmm if you if you like a bad shoe it just depends on if you re more comfortable with it okay ?
actually your right knee looks better when i see people with bad knees that that actually get bone touching bone so you got some mileage left in that knee okay ? it s it s a soft tissue thing it s where the cartilage hasn t eroded to such an an extent that uh you got bone on bone so go with the glucosamine do the exercises um you can go on the internet you can get some of the uh okay and you said now with the exercise extend my for the quads yeah you can do you can build your quads up by doing this too but see that s wearing you you out that hurts so what you can do without bearing weight is is tighten that muscle up just tighten it as far as i can just and hold it for well not as tight but you know reasonable tightness and hold it for ten seconds and then relax it if you can do that times a a day uh that ll be great it ll help ? it ll help um the other thing i noticed too getting back to the knee thing is if i wear flats too long mm hmm the it hurts worse mm hmm so i will switch to like a small heel to elevate my foot would it help if i put a a shoe thing in my flat ? you know ? you you might try that what that is allowing you to do is is is it doesn t allow you to hyperextend the knee what the heel does you know so um should i get fitted for one of those or do i could just pick one off of the shelf ? you can get one off the shelf mm hmm i didn t want to buy it unless i because i spotted it i put some gel things in my shoes but it wasn t quite enough i want to buy one of the okay alright and last but not least on this page they were talking about um the different types of surgeries and different types of prolapses what surgery would you say would be a less involved procedure with healing ?
because i do not want to go back through that surgery that i went through well first of all if you re going to have an operation you want it to be successful and i really can t comment on on the different types of procedures and i i would recommend procedure if you re going to still have you know the same problem i i would wait to see what he has to recommend each of them have to recommend before i make my decision because my last question was what would you say would be the best results ? i m not i i figured it s area specific so it s probably not something that you have the greatest expertise on but it s it s probably something very similar to what they did a mesh potentially in between those areas to um take the place of those soft tissues which have been damaged through childbirth yeah okay well i guess that s about it
mm hmm so colon and rectal you got all everything you need ? uh i think so okay just hold on yep alrighty thank you
hello ! hey doctor how are you today ? here for your physical ? mm hmm so how have things been ? real good yeah ? sit down
i forgot your name k you introduced yourself ? oh we ve met yes yes we ve met thank you
well how are you today ? besides cold one one thing is i m going to get surgery next week for um um d and c because i ve been going to the ob gyn and um i do have a note there for you to get to see if you could um i just jotted it down because you know how the anesthesiologist calls mm hmm and they want certain things ? mm hmm she said if you could i just jotted this down i was at work a cbc uh huh ekg and if possible a urine analysis fair enough i mean not even just because okay so whatever you want we ll make them happy okay um and then um i did want to ask you about that uh huh because if you listen listen can i just kind of what happened this year ? mm hmm because i haven t seen you in about a year it has been a while yeah yeah um i had gotten i thought i was in menopause so for nine months i had no period uh huh and um um like in june okay it was maybe october to june i just stopped and usually i had been pretty regular mm hmm and um i said well i m and i thought that would be it but in june if you know what flooding is mm hmm i had such heavy and i ve never been on i ve never really had heavy periods mine have been mild and easy mm hmm it was i was i was hemorrhaging really and like down to my knees and just clots like a miscarriage that bad uh huh and it went on for uh almost two weeks the first two weeks of june and i just go oh what is this ? and then i then it stopped for a few days and then it started and it went all through july so at the end of june because i know menopause they have real heavy real light mm hmm so i didn t by the end of june i was just going oh this is too long because i d been doing like six pads mm hmm and um then they said it s called flooding i started reading about it and it s kind of normal it s not normal but it s a lot of women have a hard time transitioning into menopause from what i m reading mm hmm so then that was it so he gave me something because of the estrogen in our family my sister had breast cancer my mom mm hmm my cousins aunts i go and and when i read about it it said it s too high he took blood work and he says you are not in menopause he says your estrogen is really high or it s high mm hmm but there s no progesterone to counteract it so what he tried to give me was progestin or something like that mm hmm and he goes take it for three months at the beginning of every month and then that might kick you back into a regular period mm hmm and which didn t happen because i came in in december uh and and i just it was just light pink and i go is this even a period or am i bleeding ? and they said no it s a period but it was so light one or two days so then i saw him in the middle of december dr n and he said i m doing the d and c meaning that s like i think it s very common to first try that and then this and he says the d and c will um probably either start your periods or there will be no more mm hmm and they don t know why but d and c is sometimes just uh you know and then he ll check me and see if there s anything going on but um my question is this i was thinking and i just it just occurred to me and i didn t even have a chance to ask him he he never took anymore blood work maybe now i am in uh menopause i have no example from my mom because she had a hysterectomy mm hmm so i go maybe i am and maybe it s kind of a waste of effort maybe i am so what do you think ? should i um i i would say this how long ago did he do the take the blood blood work ? like last june when i went in end of june mm hmm and you said so it was back in december that you had the then i had a little bit that light that light period that should have started october and you know after the medicine and then uh december like the beginning mm hmm and i did have something but it was so light mm hmm it was you could hardly see it i thought it was blood but but then but then nothing nothing uh uh in january ? okay so i m just wondering if it might be i don t know um i guess i would say this i think that s a reasonable thing for us to re check although a lot of times the blood work is really not all that helpful in terms of checking for menopause except in the situation going back you know where you were you know last summer um it s really late in the process that we see those hormone levels change to where um they really give us a definite answer so with with kind of where you were at last fall i would be surprised to see your hormones have gone all the way to the menopause level it s kind of a longer gradual more gradual because he was very firm about that he said and then the other thing i go get this because i i read like you know you go to border s and you see read books from harvard doctors and they all have a different take but the the same exact scenario in one of them was me just uh bleeding and i mean heavy heavy mm hmm and then they you know they said they said the end result is if you don t uh get the progesterone if there s nothing to counteract estrogen they put it in words that to me i go they say it batters your uterus and that can cause cancer so i go right so essentially there s this normal cycle of your hormones through the monthly cycle and that builds up the lining of the uterus and really at the end of the month um you know that lining gets with with the with the period and um even if it s not every month as long as it s you know every two or three months that s fine right you expect that but if it s allowed to continue to build and build which is what happened last year
you know what ? can you look at my ? i m i m always i have been i ve gained mm hmm in the last couple years and i was always in my whole life a little bit chunky i was between and my whole life mm hmm then s hit and i had the baby and i go but this is i ve often said i ve always been heavy in my stomach even when i was young and i was mm hmm i was just built that way mm hmm but this is almost like a inch i m in x inch mm hmm and i go that s one of the things i m learning about uterine cancer i m not worried because i have no other symptoms that i ve heard of mm hmm and he s not he says i doubt it s anything um because if it is i think they re catching it early but um my stomach is huge and i m thinking i is it blood maybe for a whole year that s been building up ? no ? no because that s going to be building up it s the lining of the uterus that s building up so it s not going to be collecting it s not ? so this is just probably fat it s the way i m built um right pretty much um you know and that can change too over you know over time and and as the hormones change your your body shape kind of is going to change too it is and the if you don t exercise and i just ordered a treadmill and all that and i m going to start mm hmm but um you know because that s the first sign they say about uterine cancer big bloated stomach mm hmm and i go this but there would be other symptoms right ? yeah but not not not in that spot not in that location not like that so so not really no and also when you feel i ve felt people with cancer like uh you know and they this i remember feeling you know like their stomachs and it would be like concrete this isn t this is fat i mean it all it and it s i don t feel anything so okay i don t think i m i don t think it s going to be um i think it s a good thing that he ll find out
yeah yeah and realistically i mean in thinking about that you know in terms of doing the blood work regardless that s something that you should have done yeah to go in with this and do the d and c because to to check for just to check yeah because that s another thing that will happen okay then he said uh ekg or whatever right right
and um and then is then my other question are you asking me ? i just thought i i i don t even believe in taking a lot of medicine because i think it can mess you up in ways that you don t even know mm hmm but i for the first time and i did get a treadmill and another piece and then i joined a club and i m got the kids straight where i it really is time consuming but i enjoy it once i do it so i know i m going to be going down i lost ten mm hmm and um i go the i saw something and i m just going to bounce it off you bally ? have you heard of it ? mm hmm it s at costco mm hmm what do you think ? i read the precautions um it s okay if you want to take it um it s safe um really ? how effective ? hmm you know um it it blocks the absorption of fat i read that and and the thing that happens is for a lot of people really i think what it does is it forces you to eat a low fat diet because essentially if you eat fat you get a lot of bloating and cramping and diarrhea even losing control of bowel movements so um you know and there s a prescription version of it but i would say at least half the people who take it quit because they have so many side effects oh okay and and so at the end of it all i think my own humble opinion i think really it forces you to eat a low fat diet and that s really what it does more than you know it s like the alcohol drug it s blocking huh ? where you it it is a lot like antabuse a lot like antabuse i think um in in the way it works so it forces you to eat a low fat diet and that s really what that s and so in your humble opinion what ? that that try i um sure if you want to try it that be aware that you need to make sure that you still to your low fat diet um i you know and the nice thing about it the only side effects is it can upset your stomach like that and so and i m not prone to that but you re you re saying maybe try it because then it will keep you on on the yeah you know mind you if you re eating a low fat diet i don t think it s going to add a whole lot so it s kind of up to you and how much it costs um but i wouldn t have a problem with you taking it okay because i ve never taken it i ve always thought oh that s so because then i know i ll end up gaining it back right right but maybe just for the uh i think the first are going to melt off because of number one i hear i hear that when you re bigger in the middle mm hmm it s bad because it s near your heart but also that s the easier weight to lose as opposed to in the hips and you know ? and i and i once i do exercise it does come off pretty good and at least the first it varies a lot from person to person and and i guess i would say this you know um i would focus on the trying to eat healthy if you want to take the medication fine but that s that s kind of a secondary thing um make sure and you know get into a healthy routine in terms of your diet get into the routine in terms of the exercise and the whole key is sticking to that yes i m setting up for a healthy lifestyle that s why i say i ve been learning to cook i ve been reading a lot so and i know it s going to be a long term thing that s why i m not in a hurry i m like setting it up right mm hmm
okay i think uh and then the other thing is if you have time and i might not even ask for it today i ve asked for lamisil before for my nails mm hmm and i never take it mm hmm because i m not organized enough this time i said i m not going to even ask you but ask you when i am ready to take it because then i know i have to come back in and get the liver checked and mm hmm uh can i come in on a just an off day one day ? and just say can i have or call and say can i have that s fine that s fine that s fine m good everywhere else i think okay how are things going with the headaches ? you know what ? i m better yeah ? i know how to handle them yeah and i think a lot of it that had to do with my job now oh yeah ? well that s good and so maybe some of it was uh stress mm hmm much better that can be the trigger and then i just hop in the tub and i you know when when they do come but i i don t i get them maybe once every two months okay do you take anything for them then ? yep i take uh tylenol and i get home quick and i get in the tub hot tub relax go to bed and i know it s it s for the full night mm hmm and that s just been most of my life you know ? not bad
um any problems with chest pain shortness of breath ? no she asked me that i m still wearing the patch mm hmm and uh when i tried to get off i get and then i i sometimes take one and i ve been um so i i said until i get into the exercise routine good like start the yoga class and do what i m going to plan i m keeping it on because it really helps me so in terms of the medication so you re taking the nicotine patch ? yeah milligrams or okay so you ve been using that for for quite a while now ? mm hmm and when i go to what about the and i m not going to even try it i don t think but the um because i d say i m to percent quit uh huh and then once in a while i ll fall if anything i ll bum and then once in a while i ll buy a pack mm hmm but for the most part i m quit but i heard the ob gyn was telling me there s a new one where it goes right to the brain and they re having a lot of luck with that what do you think ? do you know which one i m talking about ? it s new um the new medication ? the chantix ? i don t know what it s called um yeah you know but she mentioned it yeah i i guess i would say this i mean it sounds you know with your using the nicotine patch that s it s first of all just no cigarettes don t don t buy the pack um but and um so it really seems to me really what s happening is you re kind of now more hooked on your your your nicotine patch which is which is your your i think and i don t have time to to work with it and that s what i said i think when i exercise then i really feel stupid for smoking and that will get me off of it so i would say what you re going to need to do is to to wean wean down on the patch to you know and eventually you re going to have to go down to that milligram you might want to try doing like a you know alternating you know you know for a little while and kind of and i have been sometimes wearing this two to three days if i m having good days and uh i can wear this sometimes three days so that s almost the same thing right ? yeah absolutely so but you re going to want to kind of gradually come down but like i said but don t smoke and use the patch that s not safe so you don t want to do that at all and and really don t fall into that you know taking it off and having a cigarette because you know that s going to oh i know
so anyways um so the nicotine patch occasional tylenol any other medications that you re using or taking ? well i put down there um just as far as vitamins oh no she asked me today uh i do i do the uh um liver the what is it for not liver uh fish oil
one of those one is called because my cholesterol was real high it was like i can t remember ? mm hmm
and um and uh a vitamin uh huh and sometimes i take once in a while i take e sometimes i ll take that milligrams of aspirin just once in a while like maybe two or three times a week mm hmm and then the other one was uh sometimes the b complex when i m feeling tired mm hmm and that s it i think any calcium beyond that or ? i drink milk plenty of it how much milk ? how how many servings a day ? at least a glass but sometimes more mm hmm
and i do have uh what s it called ? lactose intolerance mm hmm i know i have that just and it comes not all my life but in the last because that s typical right ? oh yeah in your s ? mm hmm mm hmm and then i just chance it you know i love milk so but i couldn t i never used it mm hmm but um yeah that s not going to work so well with the if it s the milk that s triggering your problem oh really ? you know they they have milk with the lactaid added if you want to do that uh if you want to stick with the milk or you can get the lactaid tablets what do you think ? is that really just the enzyme that you re adding ? mm hmm oh okay well then that couldn t hurt that s uh yeah no harm in trying that if that then i will and then i ll okay
so um okay and um so um so still single i assume ? okay and what kind of work are you doing now ? um i m at ford and now i m a cleaner oh okay mm hmm
alright and in terms of alcohol marijuana cocaine ?
okay and it sounds like exercise not right now but kind of getting to that ? pretty soon getting there
in fact if i i know my cholesterol well it might not be because i m eating a lot healthier but it might be high because of the weight and i m unless it s so high and you say take that uh you know for i m not going to do it because i said i m going to first give me six months i don t want to get on it until i get the you know mm hmm i think it is weight mm hmm well i mean that certainly can help and for some people you know they can get it down with the diet and exercise and other people can t so we ll see we ll see okay and then i would give myself because i hear you can t maybe this isn t true but can you get off of it if it s low ? yeah you can um you can ? yes you can that s well why am i thinking that you can t ? that s a um i think a lot of people say that because most people who take it s true of cholesterol medications also blood pressure medications i hear that a lot about you know it s both of them are lifelong conditions so essentially you don t become dependent on the medication at all but really typically both your blood pressure and your cholesterol tend to go up over the course of your lifetime so if you need a cholesterol medication now you need it a year from now and you need it ten years from now even if you think you lose ? well the people the people in both situations that are able to come off of the medications are the people who start exercising and lose weight and that essentially they ve got their cholesterol under control with the diet and exercise and then they can stop the medication and and sometimes that happens now what do they do ? first go off and then see if it s still low ? well and if it and if it s not then it is genetic ? yeah it kind of depends i mean if if their cholesterol is doing really good and so we know when we stop the medication it s going to come up a little bit if they ve got room for it to drift up then they ll still be fine then then we stop it and kind of just recheck it and see what happens so um
and today my blood pressure was um i think that s not real high right ? no that s okay okay because usually it s lower but i think i ve been up all day i ve been up since four okay coffee great you re fine
thank you and i had a mammogram and that turned out good yep i saw that
these questions i am pretty healthy except for smoking mm hmm because when they say do have this this this and this you know i m uh huh and it could be hitting the fan pretty soon but for the most part i would say i m pretty healthy don t you ? i would say yes that you ve been pretty healthy um again yeah your cholesterol has been up a little bit and so that s something that we want to make sure we get that under control
so that s that s a yeah because i ve never had operations or uh okay
just look straight ahead open your mouth say ah good follow my finger with your eyes okay okay so do you have the treadmill or planning on getting a treadmill ? i have it i just have to have someone help me put it up
okay take some deep breaths okay you could tell if someone was i have effects from cigarettes can t you ? or no ? you would tell more from your breathing than i i mean i can hear certain things from listening but you know you would tell more by if you were having problems being short of breath go ahead and that s fine just breathe normally that s fine
you know what ? i did forget to mention something what s that ? i i was i bleed sometimes after a bowel movement mm hmm but um i m assuming it s number one it s hemorrhoids mm hmm because it s and then the other thing just sometimes that i notice the other thing is i said well when you re you get that so then they ll check it ? okay because it s not gushing it s just definitely on the toilet paper okay we ll come yeah we ll come back to that in a second do you do breast exams ?
mm hmm have you found anything that concerns you at all ? okay good inaudible and actually they re sore but i think it s from from just
and i think it s right ? like it could be getting up there and then okay go ahead and let that arm down put the other one up that s fine your legs there that s another thing because since i m here for the year sometimes this hurts on both but i think it might be my shoes mm hmm can i ? but i don t think anything s there i mean it hurts where i can t uh with the sheets uh touching it ? yeah but i think i think the shoes is it more at the end of the day that you notice it then ? um maybe because i got uh just in the last two months i got boots mm hmm but it was before that no just no no i wouldn t it just hurts but there s nothing there and that s not um so does it bother you more when you re in bed than when you re up and walking ? no sometimes it hurts when i m walking mm hmm but not that much where i would even uh come in and ask about it right not uh it could be boots right ? because what is that other thing ? plantar fasciitis ? is that what you re thinking of ? no because that s in your feet heel heel spurs ? no because that s not here tendonitis ? no what s the thing with the the gout ? people who yeah that drink no not gout that s not going to be gout then that s probably i m going to change shoes okay the key is having a good arch in the shoe mm hmm you know and you can you can go to like any shoe store or drug store and they ll have a good arch support that you can slip in there oh okay um and the other part about that is when you re at home at the end of the day like not walking in like sandals or slippers having something always that s got a good arch and i m always barefoot so maybe that s yeah yeah you know that you know whatever you use and hard floors yeah you can you can have they do make you know sandals and slippers that have an arch to them because it s all about how the weight is carried and you know by the foot and what kind of work it s doing so you know just you know things look good you look like you re in good health your lungs sound clear your heart sounds fine blood pressure is good pulses are strong i don t feel any swollen glands or lymph nodes and things look in good shape um
i feel good and so yeah and you know trying to make some of those changes in terms of you know the diet
and try to get uh to doing exercises walking on the treadmill that would be a good thing and the whole key to that is doing it regularly and my advice is to start slow don t try and do too much too fast because that s how you tend to pull muscles and twist ankles and that kind of stuff start gradually and kind of build up and do it regularly at least three days a week and try and stretch with that too to kind of loosen up and what do you think about since i have been a long term smoker all my life mm hmm i just figured it was it s been since mm hmm that what do you i read spinach so i ve been eating spinach mm hmm just to try to anything that they can do that they tell you i know it s a yeah no yeah we don t know um you know nothing really has panned out in terms of you know like the antioxidants at one point and all that was kind of we were hoping that would prevent problems and um you know they re still saying not you still could do that and try well i wouldn t i wouldn t suggest taking anything in terms of a pill i guess i would say because actually that seems to make things worse i think so too so eat healthy exercise and that s the best thing you can do for a lot of reasons and like i said the key is getting into a routine and keeping up with it and and i think the trap a lot of times people fall into is trying to do too much too fast or you know and then then it s just exactly it s all or nothing and they end up so okay yeah
um in terms of um so in terms of the routine things um we ll want to have you come back and do some blood work we ll want to do that when you re fasting and it looks like you ve already eaten today so mm hmm we can do the blood work that the anesthesiologist wants that s not a problem and we ll want to do your cholesterol and blood sugar and that stuff so i ll get you a slip to stop back and do that um we ll get the urine sample you mean right right after this go down there ? well you ve already eaten already oh yeah but not oh that s just for the diet uh diabetic isn t it ? or is that for other tests ? well for the cholesterol oh it is ? oh okay so i ll give you the slip you can bring it in one morning at your convenience uh um and
when s the d and c scheduled ? um today is monday it s on a tuesday a week from tomorrow
okay so as long as you do it within the next um you know by the end of the week so if you do it saturday you should still be okay oh you mean the cbc ? so i don t really i don t have to get anything done today right ? if i come in tomorrow or the next day we ll we ll get the urine sample from you today and we ll do the ekg while you re here today and we ll do that right here in the room but but the blood work yeah i mean the cbc we ll get with all your other blood work when you re fasting oh i didn t know you had to fast for that now how how did you have to fast ? like midnight before ? yeah when you get up in the morning you can have water just nothing to eat and for how long ? like because sometimes i can get out of my job so i might just on break mm hmm so if i don t eat anything after midnight then when could i come in in the day ? eight o clock in the morning okay good
um so and then the other thing and you had mentioned was having the colon checked screening for colon cancer that s something that you should have done um and that s um that s a test the colonoscopy it s done by the the gi specialist where they take a scope and they go in through the rectum and check out the colon um and and you are you with that ? um yeah they give you something to make you drowsy so you kind of sleep through the procedure which means you have to have somebody that s going to drive you home afterwards because you re kind of oh okay drowsy afterwards do they have to be come in with you ? yeah they got to be there the whole time is it how many hours ? um you re usually here for a few hours you know and it s like the the test itself might be like minutes but mm hmm it s like a lot of things you come in and they get you changed and they check you out and then you know afterwards they kind of watch you for a little while until you re waking up and doing okay so okay so okay so tell generally you re here for the person about four hours like yeah you re here for half a day you know basically so okay it s the same thing too as like the surgery they they don t fool around they have to be here it s not like they can come in with you and go out it s one of those things though and then is it a one of those appointments where it s a month down the road or ? yeah they ll set you up an appointment kind of yes it i don t know how long the wait is but it s usually a few weeks give or take um and the way it works is i would give you the information about doing the test mm hmm and then actually the gi department or the specialists that do it they would call you to set up an appointment oh okay that s the way that works i think and it s not tests every five years or so ? um depends on the result um but um if you re clear it s good for ten years actually so but if we find any polyps or anything then it depends on what we find so um anything else for ? nope i think that should be the main thing you had your tetanus shot a couple years back so you re all set with that did i ? mm hmm so
and your mammograms and obviously you re following up the with the gynecologist so you re all set alright any questions ? anything else ? i i can t think of anything so that s fine um you can pants on you can put your pants on but leave your shirt off so we can and bra off ? yeah leave that off so we chest to do the ekg okay i ve never had one of those okay okay someone will be with you in just a minute alright thanks good luck with the procedure okay thanks
hello how are you ? just fine how are you ? okay anything new going on ?
oh a few things but ah it s just such a pleasure to see you really every time i see you i i ve told a bunch of guys about you actually i feel like you re a good doctor huh ? well guys have asked me you know you got a decent doctor ? well i think so he answers my questions and does what i ask him to so what more is there to the job you know ? yeah that s true
and i don't know about this about this business i suppose it probably should be done because somebody has to do it right ? yeah don t worry about that well recording devices always make me a little bit uncomfortable but ah well it should be totally anonymous no so nobody can identify
well i i know and i agreed to it but ah if you can read this that s the list because she ah the wife or girlfriend wife she s a she s a nurse and she s okay so you just want me to check that right there that first thing ? what s it say ? i don t his solar plexus bulging ? oh yeah that would be probably be a good ide you think i should check that ? okay and then ah you re worried about a lesion on your ankle or wrist ? i ve got a yeah i ve got this thing i i thought it was a wart and i put ah aspirin and vinegar on it for a week or so and it scabbed up and i thought it was gone then it came back i ll take a look at it and i ve got the same same sort of a thing down here on my ankle and a couple of bumps here on my arm that i don t they look like the same thing and they seem to be going away now i don't know okay i ll take a look um and then so you have a list of these blood pressures ? ah no i don t with me she just ah she just said get the blood pressure again i don't know okay so last last week i ve been getting do you know what kind of numbers you re seeing ?
well last week it was ah i don't know if it was or and then yesterday it was ah ah i ve been getting i went and got the knee injection then i got a shoulder injection because my body s falling apart i turned and it s starting to fall apart
hm it s arthritis so i ll check the blood pressure to see what s going on do you need a refill on your medicines ? ah huh yeah on two things i need ah whatever the red blood type pressure pills are i m just about out of those ah you got the the lotensin and the norvasc you re probably getting generics on both of those i don't little little red blood type pressure pills okay i ll double check where you getting those from ? here or well ah pharmacy advantage i haven t gotten any in a long time for awhile i wasn t taking them and then i started taking them again ah i don't know a couple months ago i had a bunch of them there and ah i m starting to run out and ah you re taking two for blood pressure right ? two pills for blood pressure ? ah there s norvasc is that blood pressure ? yeah yeah that s blood pressure and ah whatever these little red pills are i take one in the morning and one at night i think they re ah lotensin which is ah benazepril you re saying they re twice a day ? yeah one in the morning and one at night isn t that the pain pill ? that too i take nine pills in the morning and six at night i don't know okay um yeah you re right it is twice a day okay um okay so you re right so make sure you get refills on that let me double check um and then what about this yoga ? what s that or what ?
ah ever since i retired i there s a yoga show in the morning at in the morning ah monday wednesday and friday i get up in the morning i exercise for about a half hour before the show comes on minutes to a half hour is going to go away
ah it doesn t make sense i mean my back is sore my neck is sore is it keeping you awake at night ? no not really ah once in awhile it does but the the the joint pain keeps me awake but the muscle soreness i can kind of live with it but i m just surprised at you know if i turn a little bit and my ribs hurt and ah everybody keeps telling me oh that yoga s great for you and all it s to me all it s doing is making me hurt what hurts the most ? well like right now my my neck is sore ah my back muscles are sore ah would you want to try some therapy on your neck maybe ? could be some pinched nerves in there well it s it s from it s from what i m doing i mean i i know what it s from and it s it s okay what are you taking for pain ? you ve got the um you still taking the salsalate ? and how many of those do you take a day ? i take two in the morning and two at night and then i take ah darvons one in the morning and one at night sometimes one during the day and i i still got a few of the ah those ones that make me sick ah what s hydrocodone ? the ah vicodin ? yeah vicodin ah if i m if i m really hurting from like my knee or or my shoulder i ll take a couple of those instead of the ah darvon ah darvon ah have we ever tried um tramadol ? i took that and it worked then it ran out i think maybe we should try that instead of the darvons okay ? i think it may be a better drug really ? you want to try that again instead of the darvon ? i m going to give you those give me some kind of warnings or tell me what is it and um it s a well tolerated drug ah no difference from darvon as far as the side effects really well i mean is is it a narcotic i got to worry about becoming addicted to or ? it s it s mild it s it s definitely not ah not ah more addicting than ah than darvocet or hydrocodone could be potentially if anything less less oh well so ah so then why not ? i don t care so it s it s mild but ah i think maybe two or three a day just like the ah
yeah like the darv like the darvons yeah we prescribe the same way okay ? let s try that i think it s it s a safer drug let s try that um now you think um your mood is a problem ? you think the pain is causing you to ? yeah that i came home one day here not too long ago and frankly i m having trouble with with wife girlfriend whatever you want to call her ah we re both packrats this now i m i m serious now we re both packrats we got more crap around the house and ah it s it s an issue that it bothers me a lot and i don't think she understands it i i came home one day here and i was hungry and ah i think i might have some kind of sugar problem to be honest with you because ah i told her i said now look shut up and listen to me and i she she s italian and she i can halfway get through a sentence and her mouth starts running and it s like if i m talking to you when i finish talking then you talk it s a fair exchange and we get some information exchanged she never waits till i finish a sentence and i told her i says you shut up and you listen now and i was i was pretty serious about it and i says i opened that refrigerator and when stuff hits me on the head because i opened the refrigerator that pisses me off a lot and the freezer is the same thing and ah i ate something and it was one of these issues she s not happy unless it s packed so full that stuff literally hits me on the head when i open the refrigerator and she s a great cook she s all kinds of stuff but that pisses me off no end and she thinks that by buying more stuff it s somehow going to declutter the house it s backwards and i tell you what i i practically went nuts that day i mean and after i ate something i was i said okay good and i was i was fine then but it was like like i was having some kind of a panic attack or something i was i just i don t normally get real angry or anything but this this is becoming a bigger and bigger issue and it was there was something more going on than just just that even though that s been an issue with me ah it felt like there was something more going on i i don t know how to even describe it well do ah do you think you could hurt somebody ? this is a common problem well i mean i could i m pretty strong i guess i could hurt somebody but ah i just have you ever just gotten to the point where you just can t tolerate it another instant ? yeah yeah oh yeah yeah it s like i i retired from gm for a reason i retired because they were having me do stupid things every day they were having meetings demanding more throughput i d go to the meeting and that s what i d done my whole life i ve tried to make things more efficient and worked as hard as i could and done everything i could to make profit for the person i m working for get the work done as quickly as possible you know my mind that leaves a few crumbs left over for me so i m going to these throughput meetings and they say we got to have better throughput well i looked at what i m doing every day and every day i m kneeling down and hurting my knees working out some limits which is on the floor in this god awful environment sticky paint all over the place and whatever and so i said eliminate the limit switches i found a switch that had no moving parts on it it just sensed the presence of the vehicle i put one in and it worked flawlessly for three months whereas every morning for maybe a couple of hours till everything freed up we d be getting calls half hour to two hours we d be down at the cost of a minute profit loss and these were going to cost a couple thousand dollars a piece to put in and we had well of them to put in well if you do the math and i i just said and no matter who i went to i went to meetings i went to the superintendent i went to the immediate foreman and they all were they were neanderthal in their thinking about it they d think it was like here s all these trees and there was no forest you know and i just finally said i can t do this anymore i just can t do it how can they tell me they want throughput every week every week they re holding throughput meetings so did you take a a buyout ? well it wasn t a lot of money and i and i don t have a lot of money and i m doing some i m working something i m an electrician so i mean people call me you know i hand out a few cards here and there and before long people call oh yeah it s simple now as far as the marital discord do you want to talk to somebody about that ? what do you think about that ? i don't know i the way the way that thing came down ah it s like there was it s like there was something wrong with me man i was i was so pissed off it just it was a combination of coming in but it was like there was something wrong with my body at the time like well your sugar could have been out of whack we re checking that um but what do you think about your overall mood though with this pain ? you think it s affecting you ? well everything i try to do i mean i go up and downstairs like like i m years old and ah ah did we ever try ah nortriptyline a little pill at bedtime helps chronic pain whether that s from arthritis or whatever pinched nerves whatever whatever kind of pain ? i don t think so we should try it it s safe no interaction with your other medications um not habit forming and ah it may help with the pain let s give it a try i m game it could cause a little dry mouth um a little bit of grogginess in the morning possibly um if that s a problem just take it earlier in the evening it should wear off by the morning okay ?
one thing that just happened when you said that i have been noticing i ve always had a pretty good sense of balance and every once in awhile i m a little i don't know what word to describe it ah for a fraction of a second i m i m a not dizzy but ah off balance or ? yeah ah and i i don't know if it s just a common i m getting old and i don t want to admit it or or what it is there s no ah ringing in your ears ? once in awhile i have a little bit of a ringing in my ears but i shoot pistols a couple times a week sometimes i mean i ve got you know ear protection on what about pain in your ears ? and the only time i hear that ringing like if i m falling asleep once in awhile i ll notice like i think it s my left ear but ah do you ever check your blood pressure at these times ? i haven t i could you might want to check your blood pressure and just make sure ah see if it s either high or low if you think about it okay i mean i ve got a sitting right next to the bed i mean
okay um i have that it s been ten years since you ve had a tetanus you think that s right ? that s an error i just had one in i think it was did i give it to you ? no ah i came to the emergency room ah this cut i cut it on a piece of rusty sheet metal as a matter of fact that was kind of interesting ah i m a little bit of a racist in that it seems like we ve got too many too many arabs and indians being doctors between but in this case it was probably better this gal had been in india and ah she d seen all kinds of cases of tetanus and so it s like wake up boy you know i mean ah
there s there s some value in having some diversity but ah i i guess it just kind of pisses me off that we we re bringing all kinds of people in to take your job or to take my job who s a white anglo saxon protestant one way or the other and ah if i were trying to get into medical school i wouldn t be able to get in my brother s got blond hair and blue eyes and they told him at general motors probably flat out if you got a split tail and dark skin you would get your apprenticeship they hired him to teach the other people how to take the test he scored so high on the test but they wouldn t give him an apprenticeship well middle class america next door next door neighbor said hey did you look behind you ? no why should i ? because walk around the house and take a look the sheriff had put him out of his house after after years of living there all his belongings are pilled up in the driveway he s gone ah and there s just all this stuff going on some of that stuff is really bothering me when i when i look at what s happening in our country i m going to probably be okay but what about all the people around me i mean you re going to be okay you ve got you ve got a job here and you do your job and what have you and you ll probably be alright but what about these all these other poor bastards who are just working and trying to make their way in life and all of a sudden there ain t no life for them ? this guy s years old he he was he lost his job two years ago as an engineer after years working because the car companies cut back on their engineering they didn t need any more machines the company went he was working for went bankrupt he s doing auto body work which he happened to know how to do but at years old he he was i mean this guy who was riding by on his bicycle all the time and in pretty good physical shape he says i m not ready to retire and i lost my job hm hm well when you when it strikes home like that it s like and then you start going around the subdivision you see all these houses without curtains in them anymore and then a few weeks later all of a sudden the sign goes up and there s notices on the window i don't know if you ve seen it where you live or not but oh yeah oh yeah it s everywhere yeah ah maybe maybe i m too care about my fellow man too much i don't know okay um well did you want to talk to somebody though ? is this getting at you ? i m more concerned about the marital discord problems cause that s that s a bigger issue what do you think about that ? think about it and you know you got coverage to go um to see a counselor okay ? oh yeah
okay um now what about a colonoscopy ? you had told me awhile ago i lost the paperwork and that was the only real reason i came here was to get more paperwork because when i called up and told them what the deal was ah you d told me to go get one and i lost the paperwork and time passed and well i should okay well they re they re going to give you some information on it i m going to submit the referral somebody from that department is going to call you if they don t call you next week then you call the number that s on this paper to set it up okay ?
you need that done um we ll check your ah prostate today you re due for some lab tests psa and so forth um now were you ah ever a smoker ? like a daily smoker ? you were never a daily smoker ? okay maybe maybe between half a dozen cigars and and two dozen cigarettes in my lifetime maybe okay good for you or a dozen maybe i don't know and you don t drink much ? you don t drink too much ? not at all okay okay um
my worst habit is that woman i ve got at home and my overeating that s the only thing i do um did you i think hap s got a deal with ah weight watchers what do you think about that ? well i should probably do it s a pretty nominal fee
i should probably do it ah i can t quite admit that i m an absolute food addict i am and i can verbalize it but i haven t quite got it in my head i overeat all the time um and one other thing i was going to mention when i was two years old i had my appendix out and that sucker hurts me about half the time and i don't know if there s anything that can be done about it or not ah if i overeat it hurts if i do this or that it hurts all kind of things it it s bothered me my whole life but it s been hurting more lately is there some alteration in your bowel movements ? mmm i used to go twice a day and now now because i have actually cut my food down some and now i ve been just going in the morning ah sometimes two or three times a day but typically just once a day i used to be in the morning and at night ah every day okay i ll take a look but we need to check out your colon um let s see ? i don t use very much and she s got this artif it s some kind of potassium salt that she uses yeah it s low sodium salt reduced sodium okay but you don t salt heavily at the table ? no once in awhile i ll put some on but not very often are you eating plenty of fruits and vegetables ? mmm not as much as i should really ? every morning i have these ah shredded wheat squares and as long as i do that it seems to be alright oatmeal would be a good choice i get here one other thing i eat oatmeal i don't know have you been around horses much ? have i been around them much ? a little bit i mean well when i was a kid i my sister had a horse with a little carriage and you didn t want to be riding in that thing if you fed the horse oats and i m the same way you mean because you have to go to the bathroom or ? no farting like you ve never heard the phrase farting like a racehorse ? i fart huh okay a lot it s not normal the amount that i fart
hmm your eardrums look okay a smidgen of wax any problems with your glasses ?
you go periodically ? how old are those ? oh maybe four months six months okay no problems with them the near and the far components ? well it s annoying because i for years i had this perfect vision and i got to be or so and i have to start wearing glasses yeah it s pretty typical and well yeah i mean the eye doctor as a matter of fact it was the doctor here he says man your pushing it buddy i said what do you mean ? i was at time and he says man you re supposed to start doing this i m thinking i don t want to do it at all cause i used to be a well i m a pistol shooter and i used i used to shoot meters with a pistol just fine and it was like looking across the room for me and i could lay a book on my face and and read the print you know it was like i had this phenomenal vision that i just thought everybody had and ah now i i can t i got to put the glasses on to read that paper there and at meters things are fuzzy well when you re used to one thing and it completely changes like that it s like now my wife she she gets i complain about it to her and she gets pissed off cause she s worn glasses all her life it s like she doesn t understand that this change is a big change the guys that are really good shooters they have much better vision than i do or ever did hm right but ah unless you unless you know how to make the comparison you can t understand it she can t understand that
hm say ahh ahhh
lift up your tongue any major dental problems lately ? no matter of fact i went to the dentist yesterday to get everything checked your usual cleaning ?
okay any swollen glands that you ve noticed here ? let me take a look at the ah lesion there just leave that alone that s something called a dermatofibroma it s like a little like thickening of the skin from scarring from a little irritation of the if you had a little nick there or a bug bite or something one right here it s it seems to be kind of going away now yeah that s the same same thing thing yeah just keep an eye on it just ah i was scratching i d sra it s what ? dermatofibroma which is fibroma is should i get it cut off or not ? well just leave it alone if it s getting bigger for no reason well i i was scratching it a lot it was itching mm hmm and i d scratch the scab off and then it would get you know take a week or so and start itching again and well i m more worried about a sore that doesn t heal an ulceration no but if you think it s getting bigger then see the dermatologist but it looks like a typical dermatofibroma which is scarring of the skin so it nodules up no raised um but it s from see that ? that s ah it s like it s some kind of mole not suspicious mm mm yeah i m not sure what those were and they re kind of like white bumps and i was scratching them and then they scarred up a little bit mmm none of that stuff looks very suspicious to me even a little keep an eye on it um okay deep breath
okay lay back for me please
here it is right here right i ll take a look can you pull up that blue gown please ? is that tender ? okay just relax is this tender over here ? mm mm so what seems to aggravate this down here ? ah if i ve got too much gas if i ve got ah ah i don't know it s just does that swell there ? no it just gets sore and if i if i haven t gone to the toilet for awhile or ah i ve got a lot of gas or ah sometimes i ll strain it i when i m doing this yoga they want you to do these funny kind of sit ups they want you to not pick up your legs and but be able to sit up and my legs aren t heavy enough and so i i rock like this and ah once in awhile that ll strain it okay well this weakness there s nothing you can do about this other than control your weight it s a stretching of the abdominal wall as your abdomen gets bigger okay it s just stretching out mm hmm but it s not at a point where we would suggest you know any kind of surgical procedure to ah like sew that tighter or anything is there anything to strengthen it at all or ? um i would just do the kind of um the only thing you can do is keep your the size of your belly down okay but your belly gets more stretched out but otherwise you can do the crunches where your knees are up and you re just going like that you re not bringing your chest all the way to your knees that s a little too strenuous just little crunches to strengthen these rectus abdominal muscles but that weakness is a function of how big your belly is okay cause it pulls apart at the midline and stretches out but it s it s not bad enough to send you to a surgeon on that can can you stand up ? i ll check the groin area turn your head that way cough well you know we need to check out your colon but ah otherwise that s just scar tissue there um i know it may be a little bit painful but i don't know i think if possible to keep your weight down it ll help with that can let s check the prostate here face the table okay here we go okay push push push push sorry okay feels okay we ll check the psa here you can wipe with those tissues and throw it in the garbage
okay so she s going to come back get a bunch of blood tests um do an ekg um give you that colon info and if nobody calls you next week then call the number that s on that paper to schedule that okay ? mm hmm
um you don t need any vaccines um and ah i ll make sure you ve got refills on your medicines i mean we should stick with the same other than we re going to change that darvon to tramadol and then we re going to add this pill at bedtime which helps with chronic pain okay okay can you give me some more of the vicodin for when i m hurting real bad or not ? okay yeah yeah i can give you that um so um so i ll let you know how the labs turn out but i don t i m checking for other types of arthritis but i think it s just all age relate wear and tear type degenerative changes um
i got one question about that i used to workout with weights and i got all these barbells laying around and stuff and the sports medicine guy told me not to be climbing stairs cause i i used to do the walking and then climb several flights of stairs to at least give some kind of exercise to my leg muscles i would probably feel better if i were doing some squats or something to exercise my legs but then i got bad knee joints is there anything i can do ah well the two exercises you can do um are done on the floor which will um help the leg muscles without ah aggravating the knee joint um you re just sitting there like this okay on the floor ? mm hmm and you slowly draw a t back and forth okay keep the knee perfectly straight slowly draw a t back that works these muscles without aggravating the other thing you can do is roll up a big bath towel rolls up about that thick bath towel about that wide sitting on the floor your knees push down hold for a second push down hold for a second push down do that like times each leg mm hmm so that works these muscles without aggravating but um um you got bad arthritis in there i think any machines or um you know might aggravate you just got to see if it seems like it s hurting then i guess i wouldn t do it you know but those are two exercises you can do to strengthen these muscles without ah um and you should be able to you know walk walk try to walk as much as you can and i don't know does the bike aggravate it ? the stationary bike ? i i haven t bothered with the stationary bike but i got a regular bike ah oh good you could ride a little bit and see how that goes then there was just do it till it hurts and if that hurts it stop ? is that what you re telling me ? kind of okay yeah well okay but ah so so um you you might look into weight watchers unless you want me to put in a referral to the weight clinic but the weight clinic is not covered okay what what s a weight clinic ? for for to help you lose weight oh yeah but it s not covered no insurance covers it mm hmm but they they ve got a deal with ah hap i mean with um weight watchers mm hmm and there s places around town look them up in the phone book it s a nominal fee otherwise she s going to give you the usual full low fat cholesterol dietary info i give you i went to yeah i know her she was going to she was going to straighten me out and i looked at her and i m thinking how can she straighten me out ? you know i mean she she was fatter than i was well yeah it s like going to the cripple when you want to get straightened out right ? i mean

okay now this pain pill that i m giving you um don t be scared it might say for depression that s in high doses we used to use it for depression in high doses but in low doses like a tenth of what we used to prescribe for depression has been shown to help chronic pain okay ? okay so i m not giving it to you to affect your mood it s for pain okay ?
i wouldn t complain if you were giving it to me for my mood i guess i don't know um i mean do you think it s a big problem your mood ? i mean do you want me to give you something to elevate your mood ? mostly i don t like to take drugs but ah i m i m wondering i don't know i think i ll just let it go for right now mmm why don t you consider calling that number and talking to somebody over there to see what they think okay

alrighty give you or well no no i brought these with me oh my letters to you so that you can explain this stuff yeah do you want to come over here where we can actually sit together ? let me put a sheet on the or do you want it on your lap or on the seat ? uh well yeah i guess on the seat okay there you go
well i think somebody s knocking on the door is the girl there ? the one for the study is she with you ? yes uh huh do you want her ? um dr is calling you what s that ? excuse me excuse me
alrighty well let s go ahead do you want to ask your questions first ?
um no i guess just um i wondered what the you know the vitamin b and vitamin d deficiency means okay let s talk about that
sorry for the interruption
mm hmm i m sorry judy okay let s talk about that we ve got uh actually mostly pretty good results so i was pleased yeah i and they re not real far the ones that are bad aren t they re really close to being okay they were just one under or yeah and so i don t even call those statistically significant i m they re not anything i want to do anything about cause next time i do them they ll just be right back up into normal and just fine but sugar sodium potassium kidney function liver function calcium protein they looked great this is kidney function as well so that was great here s your cholesterol just a little up
but better than it was last year yeah so you re you ve had some improvements and i m not unhappy with that now which one is the good cholesterol and which one s the bad one ? h is happy oh that s oh okay so that s your good one so that s the good cholesterol the happy cholesterol and you re that s a good number to have i like to see it over mm hmm under so very very good l is lousy not so good so that s the bad one the lousy cholesterol well you know not too bad mm hmm
and then your total this is your total so that s okay i m coming over here it s worse than you think because i consider normal above ah okay and you re so that s another one we need to talk about ntx was in progress when you got that and here s the ntx normal is to so that s not good that is a measure of bone breakdown in osteoporosis oh yeah so then your urine over here not bad though you know even though you have a little bit of white cells that s not bad that s actually a pretty normal urine and white and red cells were pretty normal too so the things that i looked at and said oh yes we do need to talk are the b the vitamin d and the urine ntx which is a measure of bone breakdown or calcium remolding um when i think about if that number is high you re a big candidate for osteoporosis mm hmm so so let s let s go in backwards order because um we can kind of um this is something you at least have some familiarity about because we ve talked about bone density before when was your last bone density done ? uh well that s here too it was just last week ? okay yeah and i should i should have copied the one from last year it s a little bit worse than last year not as much as i would have thought given how bad this urine ntx was you re minus in the lumbar spine that s right here you re minus in the hip now what that means is everybody wants to know why do we have minus numbers ? i specifically did not take algebra because i didn t want to deal with that but in in the average year old um iowan corn fed young woman a normal bone density is right here but that s not you that s not me so they give us some slack a handicap so for us normal it goes all the way down to minus so in measuring bone density this is all normal but from minus down to minus we begin to have bone loss some people call it osteopenia other people call it early osteoporosis so however you want to look at it osteopenia but it s really early osteoporosis and then down from minus is full blown osteoporosis so there you go you re really right about here so i m in the pretty early stages of uh yes however how steep is the slide ? i look at this number and it suggests to me that the slide is steep so that means i see you slipping down this down this continuum pretty fast in trying to predict the future and we require vitamin d to put calcium into our bones to build strong bones so not only are you taking calcium out of your bones but what we need to put calcium into our bones is very low in you mm hmm so i see this as as making a terribly rapid slide in this direction in you given what we currently know and so we need to do something you need to do something and i can help you alright ? your calcium your viactive is that how you re taking your calcium now ? yeah but i ve well actually lately i ve been last until i got the um uh heartburn thing um i was taking it pretty good but before that i wasn t mm hmm so um but then it said on the heartburn thing that calcium wasn t good for heartburn so i don t but i figure i have to start taking it again yeah you do did viactive increase your heartburn ? well i was wondering if it did because i didn t have heartburn until i was taking it more consistently but i think also just most of the things i eat i could see would give me heartburn like coffee and so i ve been trying to cut back on all that stuff mm hmm we think that caffeine might actually increase your ntx as well increase your remodeling or pulling calcium out of the bone i m not sick this is called seasonal
so now that the weather has turned nice i know i start doing this the same things too that so i m not contagious judy so you think the viactive might have been increasing your heartburn ? did you did you take viactive with meals or separate from meals ?
usually separate so there s an opportunity there to try taking it with meals breakfast and dinner or breakfast and bedtime snack mm hmm well that well i know with the heartburn i m supposed to stay away from bedtime snacks well yeah yeah so breakfast and dinner dinner yeah might be the most appropriate thing for you you could try that if that s if you like the viactive and that s how you d like to get your calcium mm hmm there s vitamin d with that yeah i was just looking at that so you ll get your calcium and your vitamin d twice daily mm hmm um but do it with meals yeah and i was often only taking one and then drinking orange juice or which now i had to cut back on the orange juice because of the heartburn too so yeah in fact i d say eliminate your orange juice yeah i if you want orange juice eat an orange mm hmm you ll get less heartburn with an orange or you should theoretically than with orange juice because you ve got the fiber with it and the fiber helps to um to hold it and to prevent the reflux from occurring yeah cause um yeah i was i m still taking that prilosec and i wondered when do i stop ? like i still have a teeny bit of heartburn when i go to bed then don t stop don t stop ? do you take it once a day or twice a day ? uh once a day in the morning or in the evening ? in in the morning okay when were your worst symptoms in the morning or evening ? uh in the evening you might reconsider when you take your prilosec and take it either at around dinnertime or even later in the evening oh okay yeah and see then if you can eradicate all your symptoms because it ll be the strongest then when your symptoms would normally be the worst but it should still act over a hour period of time so it ll help you during the day too mm hmm theoretically you know everybody s different but why don t you try taking it in the evening ? i m going to write some of these things down for you okay because yeah for like a week i couldn t i was like nauseous all of the time i couldn t hardly eat but then it seemed to kick in more and i felt better great so take prilosec in the evening i just put pm i ll let you choose try at dinnertime see if you like it then try it at bedtime see if you prefer it then and see if it carries you through through the day mm hmm if it doesn t carry you through through the day and when you take it in the evening you have daytime problems when you take it in the morning you have evening problems still take it twice a day oh well i think probably one because it keeps getting gradually better but at some point you stop taking it don t you ? not necessarily not everyone not necessarily ? some people do if you get totally better then i tell people um back off to the level that you absolutely need to control your symptoms so if you re taking it once a day and your symptoms are all gone try taking it every other day if your symptoms are still gone try taking it once a week oh okay if your symptoms are still gone try taking it once every two weeks mm hmm some people then back so just off enough that they just take it as needed but other people need to take it once a day or once a week just to control their symptoms the major thing is you don t want to have ongoing symptoms because the more avid that burns your esophagus the more likely down the road you could develop esophageal cancer we have a name for that it s called barrett s esophagus but um you don t want to just be living with acid coming up and burning your esophagus mm hmm so you do want to stop that that burning from happening and prilosec doesn t stop the reflux but it stops the burning okay ? so take prilosec in the evening or try that and then the viactive i ll take twice a day with meals
mm hmm take viactive as your dessert after your meals take viactive two times daily with meals okay that ll be good now in addition to the vitamin d that you re getting with viactive we need to supplement even more vitamin d for about weeks to get your level up because you re really quite low mm kay you can t feel it you re not going to feel the difference but your body knows the difference we need vitamin d for strong bones but we also need it for our immune system and a lot of other things that our vitamins are essential so i m going to give you a prescription vitamin d that s called drisdol that you re going to take for weeks once a week for weeks oh okay once a week mm hmm weekly for weeks when you re done with the weeks of the prescription vitamin d you will still be using the viactive mm hmm and we ll be monitoring your vitamin d to make sure that it stays up once we ve built it up and with remembering to do the viactive twice every day and that s important any questions about the d and the ntx ? did we answer them ?
no no that s clear what about the b ? okay b as we age and that s not to say you re old because some people um have this problem even at a young age a very young age their our stomachs don t absorb vitamin b anymore like they used to or sometimes they never did sometimes we re actually producing antibodies to the intrinsic factor that allows use to absorb a vitamin b but sometimes we re just not absorbing it and we really don t know why mm hmm and you are not absorbing it in your food um because you do eat meat and you do eat eggs and you do take in dairy products mm hmm that s where we get our b from mostly is meat eggs and dairy and you re getting those things in your diet but it s not being absorbed it s passing through you so we need to supplement because that s an essential vitamin a really essential vitamin and if you went very long meaning years a few years with this very low level you d start to notice problems neurologic problems shakes um difficulty even communicating a dysphonia difficulty in getting out what you wanted to say so neurologic problems do occur with this being low and i have actually had a patient come to me with neurologic problems we found it was the b deficiency so although it s not common it does exist it s not just in textbooks so we need to get that back up there s a couple of different ways to do that and i m in the process of changing my view of how i want to do that i used to give everybody shots once a month well that s a real hassle in everybody s life but i didn t know that there was anything better out there i ve subsequently found that vitamin b pills that you can get at your pharmacy are pretty good for most people and they usually put enough b into you that you absorb enough but those people who are producing antibodies to the intrinsic factor and so can t absorb it it doesn t work very well they ve just recently created a sublingual vitamin b pill that you put under your tongue and it goes into the bloodstream from your tongue so it never goes to the stomach that s brand new and that s where where i m going with most people now try that one and let s see if we can t get your b up where it belongs by sublingual absorption alright ? now that s a relatively new pill so that means you re going to have to see if your pharmacy has it and see if they ll order it they should order it for you i think most pharmacies now are very savvy that they don t want to lose customers and so if they don t have it on their shelves talk to the pharmacist and say my doctor wants me to have sublingual vitamin b will you order it ? and usually they say sure but also ask about the price i have no idea what kind of price it s going to be if it s going to be really expensive it might not be the best route for us right off the bat so let s see i m going to put down vitamin b i m hoping that you can get milligrams sublingual daily alright ? now after when we re doing all of this we ve got the viactive the the prescription vitamin d the sublingual b i want to recheck all these values in three months and see where they are return to lab in three months and the lab s open from seven am to five pm monday through friday mm hmm
and it doesn t have to be fasting they ll know what to do well actually i ll give you the lab request form mm hmm and you can put it on your refrigerator or whatever and then when it s time to come back just take it to the lab and they ll know exactly what to do and then i ll get the results and i ll send them to you like i always do alright ? mm hmm
so let me leave this here in case i want to add to it but that takes care of b d and urine ntx and those were the biggies that we turned up mm hmm with all of this and now you know what your good cholesterol and your bad cholesterol is and you know about bone density you re doing really well ! mm hmm
we did some spirometry it turned out normal it looked really good okay let me go to my list now what do i have ? allergies flonase one squirt in each nostril daily are you doing that every day ? mm hmm do you have to ramp that up in the spring when the blossoms come out or ? uh no not
mm kay when was the last time you saw your eye doctor ? uh well i need to go a couple years ago and he sent me a thing to go and i do actually have some floaters in this eye so he needs to look at that alright i would like you to make an appointment with your eye doctor there s another reason we re now seeing that there may be an association between the steroid nasal sprays and glaucoma so i do want you to have your eye pressures measured so i m just going to write down here eye doctor that s a real eye doctor ophthalmologist yeah i go to a retinal thing because i have i m so near sighted mm kay well make sure they check your eye pressures i want you mm hmm to have a yeah yeah glaucoma check they do
okay ? no last time you said to not take it and see that was when we were supposed to see how i did without it uh huh and you ve done very well oh so it s a teeny bit higher my blood pressure but it s not it s okay you ve done well we ll just we ll just watch it mm kay asthma you ve got your advair mm hmm and your advair what are you using ? yeah well i was just there and he said when this time of year probably i should take the and then in my non allergy times take the mm hmm mm kay and you saw dr ? did he feel like you were doing well ? um well my peak flow wasn t too good that day so he was thinking i wasn t doing quite as well as i was cause i was taking the and i still am until i finish it and then go back to the he thought for the this time of year yeah and i noticed in when i looked i looked at his note before i came in here and when i saw that he thought well you know maybe you should be increasing your medicine that s why i did the spirometry on you to see but you hadn t even even increased you re still yeah yeah no on the yeah and actually i think it s just yeah a little bit of a spring allergy thing but i m not using my albuterol so i m still doing okay alright okay wonderful i like to hear that that you don t need the albuterol yeah i always take that and i i made the appointment for the um stress test you did ? yeah it s in april sometime i think middle of april mm kay so that ll be good to get those results and your cholesterol it s better so you re taking you re not taking anything ? you re totally diet controlled you were on lipitor every other day well i think you re fine i think you re fine to just be diet you must be eating healthy yesterday what d you have for breakfast ? uh yesterday i had cereal what kind of cereal ? uh mini wheats ? okay and uh two percent milk or yeah it was two percent milk and what d you have for lunch ? um what did i have for lunch ? i remember i had half a turkey sandwich oh and cooked broccoli good what d you have for dinner ? um a frozen dinner it was um sweet and sour chicken with rice very good okay so you re eating a lot healthier you think ? uh yeah i guess i did well right now because of this other usually i eat more salads but now i ve been cooking the vegetables instead because i but now i think i m going to try and get back into the salads again i think my stomach can handle it mm kay but yeah actually i m trying to eat more mm hmm fruits and veggies because of the stomach thing i ve been eating weird stuff that i wouldn t normally i ve been eating macaroni and cheese and things i don t normally eat ew that are high in fat too yeah and i m realizing high in salt too which i i got to stay away from but they were you know things that didn t make me feel nauseous so i was eating them but i i can get back to better things now yeah now that spring is here you re feeling better okay um dr does your gynecologic exams does he ? mm hmm okay so nothing new on the surgeries nothing new on the family medical history ? no my mom s fine

a monday well thank you for allowing k to come and given her permission to come in hear why not ? all the horrible things i have to tell you huh ? why not ?
so how ve you been ? pretty good pretty good you hesitated well i lost my mom and then we found a sister a full sibling that had been given up for adoption before my parents were married so we found her this year so it s been a that s nice it s been good it s been quite a journey yeah yeah was your mom ill ?
she was uh well yeah sort of she had some chronic stuff going on but it was quite a surprise we thought she was going to be around for a while and so her passing got one of my sisters thinking about this baby that had been given up for adoption and that was out there somewhere so your sister knew about it ? we all knew oh you all knew oh we all knew that there but my father didn t know that we knew anyway it s um oh that s interesting so we so your mom told you but your dad never told you ? we re never spoken and my parents never spoke of it in the some years they were married so it was the big secret so anyway we decided to find her and found her in about seconds on google i know ! that s a long time thirty whole seconds ! and she actually had been looking geez ! for us since so we found her and we visited a few times and um so i ve got another sister yeah yeah quite a year how did she feel about connecting ? how did she feel ? mm hmm is she she s thrilled she s thrilled really ? yeah yeah so was she looking for you guys ? so yes yeah she knew likewise that she she had been looking well she was raised in a family that was very open about uh adoption and so she knew and then just i don t know what happened in to cause her to start looking for us but mm hmm but she was unsuccessful ? right right and hadn t gotten any nibbles she registered with the massachusetts state registry of adoption and had not gotten any nibbles until our nibble in march and you know yeah yeah it s very freaky so you knew her name ? we knew the birth name you knew the birth name okay so we used that to google and we found her and actually her parents her adopted parents named her my mother s name not knowing not knowing that it was my mother s name oh you re kidding ! oh they had no idea so she was that is wow i know i ve got goose bumps that s fate it just yeah that s just what s her name ? joan wow okay
am i what am i opening ? my mouth ? open yes and say ah very good not red there no pain for you ?
diverticulitis ? i don t know i wrote it down because i ve had some the last couple weeks some pain to the point of doubling over after eating some weird little not weird after eating popcorn and pecans so i don t know it s and i ve never had problems like that before so i thought i ll just ask you maybe it is maybe it isn t what side were you having the pain on ? just right over here and i could literally feel it moving down and then when it passed i was fine so i don t know why it s just huh ? actually it s more yeah so i can make sure they work have you had your colonoscopy ? no i know ! i know i know i think of you every day as i m not calling them as i don t call them i think of you as i don t call knowing i was we were going to be having this conversation uh huh uh huh uh huh yeah i will i will i promise even more important now because that s when you can actually see the right there yeah there are little become inflamed and the way they become inflamed is something getting stuck in there and staying stuck there and it can become an infection and that can make you really sick where you require a lot more stuff being done which means the treatment is one making the diagnosis that we ll do with your colonoscopy this year ma am yes ma am we ll do that yes ma am mm hmm we ll do that so with your colonoscopy if we see the there then the goal is to try to prevent you from getting an infection and that s avoiding those kinds of things yeah yeah now i ve never had problems with nuts or popcorn in the past so i don t know if it was just that it was movie popcorn versus popcorn we have at home with an air popper oh okay okay i don t know so and it really it s it happened they both happened within the last ten days but never before it hasn t happened since ? uh huh and you ve had popcorn or no i have not tomatoes or nuts ? okay i don t have a problem with tomatoes or strawberries or none of the little things that have seeds so i don t know maybe it was just an anomaly and we ll never see it again right yeah hope that we ll never see it again i like that take a listen to your heart here
and take some deep breaths
very good your lungs are clear no problems for you with chest pain or shortness of breath when you exercise ? you re and you are exercising ? i am exercising you are exercising ! how much exercise are you getting ? um pilates four days a week four days a week weights weight class one time a week and then walking three days a week excellent excellent how do you like the pilates ? i love it i love it that s what i keep hearing i keep threatening to to check out a class phenomenal twenty two minutes a day three or four days a week and i have dropped a skirt and pant size within days that s enough to motivate hmm ? yeah yeah i would uh think about doing it a lot more dropping a pant size what about flexibility ? do you notice any oh yeah flexibility ? and in my weight class um since i ve been doing pilates all summer when i went to the weight class i didn t have any trouble doing crunches and leg lifts so it really has worked on the um the stomach you know the abdominal muscles the obliques and everything yeah i m very very pleased it works it works on strengthening the core of your body which you know which you need for balance
being able to tie your shoes when you re ninety nine ? i don t know if i m going to do that when i m well i think i d rather be with jesus by that point right ? that would mean a longer time in ? there you go so yeah you re right yeah yeah that might not be such a bad idea yeah there are days when you go come today please i m ready i m ready i m ready today would be a good day good day
that has been such a comforting thought as i m grieving my mother knowing that i will see her again and that she s with him now so mm hmm it really has been a comfort and i ve heard people say that in the past and thought maybe that was just something people said you know to make themselves feel better but for me it really has been a big comfort for the family to know that that s where she is but it s not over yeah so i love that i do too
when my father died before he died um he had not received christ years before he died mm hmm and he was ill for a while and once they called me because he was so ill they thought he was going to die pretty soon so i rushed and went with him to doctor s appointments and so forth so anyway that night and of course i was raised from a very traditional southern family you don t speak back you reverence your parents you whatever they say is gold and and i just remember that night having that conversation with him all of us in our family meeting saying dad i don t care whatever you do today s the day you need to accept jesus christ as lord today not tomorrow today is the day i know what the doctors have said i don t even care that s it i want to know that if something happens to you tomorrow that i will see you again that s all i care about and and he did ? he did that night you know and he cried and wept and you know you all cried ! we all cried and wept and my mother like oh these years of of praying for him and for it to to happen and he lived maybe another year or two after that but that s the moment i keep going back to as painful as the loss was that night changed the course for our family
mm hmm yeah that makes a difference i ll let you slide all the way down alright well catch me tell me that s right i ll catch you i will not let you fall am i getting close ? you re you re in a good spot that looks good
so tell me about the menopausal symptoms you re having too well um hot flashes aren t too bad okay not too bad i m more concerned with the memory loss losing words um losing words hmm
you know not being able to find a word as you re in mid sentence um and really the hot flashes come and go but it s just the mental feeling like i m in a fog sort of thing which leads me to then the mm hmm is it and i i don t want to be melodramatic but mm hmm is it is it menopause ? is this a hormonal fog that i will come out of at some point ? or it is the early you know very very beginning of alzheimer s ? mm hmm now we don t have any any history of alzheimer s in my family on either side that s good that s good um so but i just wanted to know is there a way are there some sort of tests or studies could be done ? something we could do mm hmm to find out which it is ? tell tell me about the the memory changes you do notice is it short term long term ? short term short term short term so remembering what you did last week ? or remembering a phone number that you re trying to remember ? yeah yep um when does it seem to be the most pronounced when ? to you ? yes is it remembering numbers remembering names remembering events ? it s sitting in session with clients and not remembering really not being clear about what they said the week before the other thing i m a little concerned about and it sounds kind of funny except that it has me worried is throwing an apple core in the laundry basket and putting the potato chips in the refrigerator and you know things that i ve never done before you know that s a little different so and yet i had breakfast with two friends on saturday and they re doing the same thing and they have both just entered menopause mm hmm is that uncomfortable or just pressure ? just a little pressure maybe just a little not too bad not too bad okay mm hmm okay okay and for what time period would you say ? probably just the last nine to twelve months mm hmm months okay which i think is probably when i experienced the onset i think of some of the symptoms
okay and nothing your mom die ? last well that s the other thing could it be grief ? you know she died the end of last summer when it started you know so it could be a variety of things i guess i m just looking for the you know the opportunity to rule some things out
okay good good um i m grateful to be able to tell you especially in the early phases of menopause not to be able to focus as well and that loss of focus and concentration means that your memory is also affected so it s usually more changes in focus ability to focus and concentration and then gaps with the memory as well because of those things occurring together you don t have to take a medication for that as a matter of fact we used to recommend that you take vitamin e for that uh huh i think we ve talked about the vitamin e but that s no longer recommended um it was supposed to help to decrease your risk of alzheimer s and dementia increase memory help hair growth help your heart da da da da da all of that has been proven to be wrong and that it can actually increase all causes of death and all causes of illness if taken ius or more so don t use vitamin e okay ! those very reasons for alzheimer s and memory don t use vitamin e um other than in your multi vitamin or in your diet mm hmm keep taking a multi vitamin if you re not able to eat a well balanced diet which should help with a through z including a little bit of vitamin e is there but not in the dosages that would be considered harmful for memory the recommendation is to work on things for your memory well i do crossword puzzles all the time okay and work on on memorizing things you know where um you could memorize the memorize the books of the bible all and doing them in groups i am going to memorize the states and their capitols i am going to memorize um my top ten telephone numbers from my cell phone instead of just doing speed dial or contact list mm hmm you know actively working on something to increase your memory and see how you do with that exercise if you have a significant problem doing it where you really can t do it um because one not where you can exclude oh it s been too busy i haven t gotten enough sleep i ve been too distracted from everything else going on mm hmm eliminating those things so that that s not a factor if you have a real problem doing the telephone list states or bible list then there is a study that we can do uh we have a memory clinic where we actually do work ups for memory loss and alzheimer s which right now if i sent you they would laugh but um we we can do that if we need to the other thing is hypothyroidism hypo under active thyroid can also cause a problem with memory especially in women over uh huh we ll make sure that that s done and i think i should have your thyroid test with your blood test that you did to make sure that it s not coming from your thyroid or that it s not coming from anemia or diabetes so any metabolic disorder can also cause you to have a problem with memory so um with your blood test we ll know that it s not coming from well i did i was in last week and had the lab done and so i have the results you did ? perfect you probably have them in the that means i sent them to you yeah so they re in the computer yes that s good let me help you forward
oh i m right there on the okay yes you are see you did such a good job i didn t have to ask you to scoot again you did such a good job could you look oh i m sorry yes i ll take you out of the stirrups
get you out of those i have on my list i have a little it s not a big deal it s right there just a little cyst on my heel and it doesn t hurt unless i ve done a lot of exercising so i mean it s livable i just want to make sure that that s all it is is just a fatty cyst it is okay alright no nothing that you have to do with it there what about pain here ? no not at all do you see how it yeah i can see that eah no pain okay so it s not a heel spur uh uh it s just under your skin okay not a big deal mm hmm unless it gets much worse and usually what happens it s the back of your heel rubbing against shoes especially if you re wearing higher heeled shoes where your heel is up and the rest of your foot s down and to rub against the back of your shoes okay alright we ll have to surgically remove that tomorrow if you want perfect ! we ll just do the surgery schedule the surgery for tomorrow what else do i have to do tomorrow ? just add that to the to the list sure sure
of things to do you know your mammogram have you done your mammogram this year ? i m going thursday at ten o clock perfect did i already send you the order form ? thank you ma am you re on top of things uh huh uh huh so you ve had your mammogram appointment made and you re going to call today you said to make the appointment for your colonoscopy ? sure yeah i will uh huh uh huh lakeside dr s is the gastroenterologist that i like make the appointment with him dr s do they have good drugs ? very good drugs the worst part for you will be not uh not knowing that it s over until you wake up you ll go i m ready they ll say i m sorry it s over we ve already done it so colonoscopy
and for the menopause nothing else that we really need to do other than to treat the symptoms as they occur
alright the heel heel cyst we don t need to do anything about
we re going to work on the memory
and you ll let me know if those aren t working we ll do something more and the we will address because you ll have your colonoscopy is this right madame ? the only medicine you re taking is the elavil and the celebrex ?
mm hmm the of the celebrex is that what it is ? mm hmm okay that s it and the milligrams of your elavil good you re allergic to the penicillin and the cipro and your last tetanus was ?
i have no idea well k should have been able to tell you that we should have that for you we should have that in for you there s that okay that s your medication list your mammogram s scheduled who had breast cancer in your family ?
my sister and my grandmother sister and grandmother and prostate cancer in your ? uh hypertension ?
dad and alcoholism ? grandparents me no one else ? uh well my brother s a recovering heroin addict but not alcoholism um there s a lot of drinking in my family so okay and you ve not had a drink in ? i ve been sober ten years ten ! should i put stars by that ? ten !
ten years ! ten years pilates walking and weights and fruit vegetables protein okay you re doing good there good okay alright let me get some medications do you need any refills today ?
i don t no none ? i m good
you re good with your medicines okay no refills okay make sure something else that you need to have done your tetanus we did in oh good okay so you re up to date so the only thing you need guess what ? blood pressure ? cholesterol the only thing you need is your colonoscopy and you ll be up to date with everything that s the only thing you re missing is your colonoscopy your pap smear i ll submit for today you will be good there
look how nice the hemoglobin is i like that you mean you are not anemic on your most recent labs ? i m not anemic ekg there must be a mistake there well the ironic thing is is now my blood pressure i mean my cholesterol is high because i ve been eating red meat so i could get your iron up mm hmm yep and so now i m going to have to get it down yeah your cholesterol last year was i know uh last time your bad cholesterol ldl was now mm hmm so you have gone up even your good cholesterol though which i would expect it to actually be higher is at and the good cholesterol goes up with exercise so uh september th when you did your labs um you were actually low for the good cholesterol in women you want it above there s an opportunity there just to get that better the rest of your electrolytes here are normal the the liver study i m concerned about when it s too high so that s fine your thyroid function was normal and your blood count was superb mm hmm up from when you were last year you were at so even better than you were last year but you can see years prior you were in the s and s so this is excellent excellent going to make me have faith in people doing what they say that they ll do just to make me change my mind about that
alright alright i can do that the only other thing is bone pain in my hip and knee in your hip and knee okay um to the point where i couldn t i i went to a conference a couple of weeks ago and so there was a lot of sitting but the pain was so great on the outside and the inside of the hip that i couldn t cross my legs and the the knee kept throbbing and i had to get up and stretch it and so i don t know what it is i m getting a look what ? two guesses as to what it is is it ? that i m not sitting yes mm hmm when you re moving around it s it s better ? uh huh okay does the celebrex help when you take it ? no ? do you take that every day or celebrex ? mm hmm i try not to take it every day because i m concerned about liver damage but if i don t take it for more than a couple days in a row the arthritis in my spine really acts up so but it doesn t do anything to the hip pain okay because that s exactly what you re describing arthritis in your hip and knee it s not at all uncommon when you have arthritis in one joint you usually have multiple joints yeah i got it okay with arthritis yeah but the celebrex actually should help with that it s an anti inflammatory it doesn t touch it even when you take the celebrex it doesn t touch it ? uh uh okay is that like once when you take it or if you re taking it i just take one capsule in the morning every day so you re taking the the celebrex every day except for those few times when you don t take it and even on those times when you ve been on it let s say for a week you would still have pain with your hip and your back i mean hip and your knee hip and my knee not my back yeah that should actually be helping your hip and your knee too and the pain in my knee is behind the knee cap so it s and the pain in my hip is right at the joint on both the inside and the outside and and i know there s nothing there but um i don t and it s a deep deep pain so my only concern was bone on bone for the hip really actually more so than the knee bone on bone you ve got i ve got what ? is it ? and actually both knees yeah okay but that s what it is in which joint would you say it s the worst ? let s get a picture of it ma am do you have time to um go to while you re here ? today ? um you can do it today if not today you can go without an appointment any day that s uh convenient for you let s do that that s what i believe you re describing what can you do for left hip ? uh what can do you for pain in the joint ? celebrex or anti inflammatories the other is regular exercise weight reduction and something that helps with cartilage that s believed to help the cartilage re build up in your joints is something called glucosamine and chondroitin mm hmm if you use that consistently three times a day for about three months you should usually get a response within three months if you use it for three months and you have no response it feels no different using it for six months isn t going to make it better um so if you don t get a response in three months it s not helping you you don t have to continue to take it if you do get a good response stopping it you ll go back to where you were so try the glucosamine and chondroitin okay i can do that and we ll see what your hip actually looks like
alright so your hip x ray and i also want to give you the cards to do as well the stool cards why should i do that since you re doing the colonoscopy ? um if your stool cards come back showing evidence of blood we re going to do the colonoscopy sooner rather than later um so that will be my way of looking to determine how quickly you need to get it done if it comes back being fine as long as you get it done this year that s fine for me okay so i ll let you know the results of the colonoscopy of the stool cards and um tell you whether or not i need to help you to get that appointment okay you don t have any of those things alright so we will fax this over to lakeside what would that be ? um for the colonoscopy um you can get it done at lakeside main campus or west bloomfield
lakeside s closer so i ll fax it to lakeside you don t need any shots today your ekg today also looked good today so nothing abnormal there so we ll fax that to lakeside mammogram order form you have i ll also give you a copy of your preventative screening which shows where you are and you will note that you are fine with everything except cholesterol ? oh colonoscopy i can hardly say it yes i know see i m trying to help you yep yep yep this will be for the x ray that you ll get done of your hip at any site lakeside any x ray facility that s close to you we can do the the uh x ray of the hip and make sure that s fine mammogram order form you already have and this is your medication list so you ll have your medication list and you don t need to do anything with the rest of your blood tests thank god we don t need to add more iron now you re right the balance between the cholesterol and your blood counts keeping them uh up to where they are most of the foods for your cholesterol are not good for your blood counts i know right because yeah it s it s meats that um actually help but they re um you can do a multi vitamin with iron you can do iron supplements alone too if you want so those are very harsh on my system yeah and it does make you constipated well and i tend to go that way anyway because that s just my body so that wouldn t be a good thing to do to you i ll figure something out um well increasing the exercise that s going to help your hdl to go higher and so that will help to offset your cholesterol numbers too so that that would be good alright madame anything that i missed ? no no did i miss anything ? i think we went down my list i have we covered everything ? i need my little green piece of paper i think there s a phone number on there get your little green ah ! okay so i ll make sure to leave your green piece of paper thank you for bringing your list thank you well see if i don t bring it i d forget it i d forget what i needed to talk to you about alright so that ll be the next thing coming to your appointment with all of the list of your concerns memorized yeah yeah okay alright so see there we go that ll be an exercise yeah yeah september september th we re dictating on patient first name last name patient last name patient id number troy primary site chief complaint history and physical hpi year old caucasian female presents herself for physical exam and pap smear patient does have multiple concerns that she wishes to discuss today current medications elavil milligrams daily celebrex milligrams daily or as needed uh allergies to penicillin cipro uh past medical history significant for alcoholism patient has not uh drank however in ten years also significant for abnormal mammogram chicken pox tetanus in surgeries none colonoscopy none family history significant for substance abuse with heroin with her brother alcoholism in her grandparents dad with prostate cancer and hypertension sister and grandmother with breast cancer social history patient doesn t smoke exercises with pilates walking and weights she doesn t use drugs um doesn t drink at all again it s been ten years since she last had a drink doesn t have any weapons in her home she is a clinical therapist two people living at home she s married sexually active with a male partner typical diet proteins fruits vegetables and whole grains review of system significant for um symptoms that patient noted after eating some popcorn and um pecans patient said she had got a pain somewhat in the mid upper gastric area has never had symptoms like that to occur before is concerned about possible pillow
oh ! to help with hot flashes and night sweats at night it s great what does it wick wick wick away the the perspiration ? exactly it s made from the material that marathon runners use so it quickly absorbs any sweat from your body into the garment and then dries it very quickly fabulous i did think of one more thing that i didn t write down yes ? um and i think it s menopausal vaginal dryness vaginal dryness intercourse is very difficult yeah you you need to use a lubricant and you were dry even on today yeah um the ky there are some special lubricants that one called id i d um what s the name of the place ? priscella s oh okay in this area actually has it i know well isn t it at the local drugstore ? ky works just as well it s just a little messier but this product called id is actually kind of clean to use and makes intercourse a lot better yeah if things are really bothersome where you re getting vaginal bleeding i can use an estrogen cream that we can use vaginally but i prefer to not do that unless we have to me too okay alright
uh next left hip and knee pain there is evidence of um of in patient s left and right knee um symptoms most likely related to osteoarthritis especially with patient having a history of osteoarthritis in her spine she ll continue to use the celebrex she ll try using um glucosamine and chondroitin to see if those help um we did discuss the need to use those for at least three months to get results if results however are not beneficial in three months there is no need to continue the medication next um rule out alzheimer s patient s symptoms are not significant for alzheimer s although she has some notices noticed some gaps with her ability to retain short term information she ll do active memory exercises including memorize lists states dates uh books of the bible telephone numbers anything that she chooses if she has a significant problem with maintaining memory and trying those tasks she ll give me a call and we ll determine whether or not a referral to the memory clinic would then be beneficial next left uh cyst on heel area very small um small and fluctuant no need for treatment most likely from irritation and rubbing on the back of her shoes if it becomes painful and there s more irritation she can cover that area with a band aid if needed for uh to prevent continued irritation next preventive medicine patient will receive her colonoscopy mammogram stool cards times three um please notice as well she will also receive an x ray of her left hip ekg here in the office with normal sinus rhythm no acute changes present rate of end of dictation did i cover everything ? i think you did i hope i covered everything did i say colonoscopy enough do you think ? yeah i think you did think we just might be able to get that done this year i would have said it enough to make sure that it s done this year ? okay i just want to make sure i mean because if you don t think i said it enough oh no i think really i think you did i can repeat it again i don t want to you know leave anything out that would i was giggling to myself thinking of patients trying to get to the memory clinic and not being able to remember directions oh god ! how do i get there ? sorry sorry ! what did they tell me to do ? go where ? i m supposed to go where ? right that s a good point i d better start writing that down you re right telling people to go there might not be enough i might actually need to start writing that s it go to the memory clinic that s right give them directions alright with the directions on how to get to the memory clinic alright madame i m going to let you dress let me fax this over to lakeside for you everything else i have there for you except the stool cards except the stool cards thank you i need to get the stool cards that sounds like a whole lot of fun too oh you re going to love that woo ! the fun just keeps on happening keeps on coming that s right keeps on coming thank you you look great oh so do you well you always look great thank you well i m trying you know being it just gets a little harder every year i know i m jealous every year alright sorry about your mom thank you but happy about your sister thank you very much okay bye

uh since i m taking the zoloft they are not as severe severe yeah you re taking what milligrams still ? and that s working okay for the anxiety and stuff ? yeah oh yeah it s it s working good
and the allegra you still use as needed ? i have to take i take it every single day okay it s not as needed no i take it every single day but it s not the decongestant one it s just the regular
xanax ? are you still having to use that or not really ? i only use that as needed and that s also rarely ? that s excuse me ? that s also rarely ? uh there it depends i can t remember the last time i took it it s been quite a while more than a couple months
okay and uh you take a multivitamin and some calcium supplements and stuff or you haven t been doing that ? since we moved into our condo i i keep telling my mother i was like a you know vitamin person uh huh i was taking all these other things we moved into the condo and everything moved to a different spot and i can t remember to take them yeah but you know just make sure i ve got to take the vitamin i know i got to take it i can t take the silver vitamin because after two or three nights i can t sleep so i just have to take the regular but i just don t have a problem with taking them i just don t remember how about calcium ? do you drink milk ? no but i do eat cheese how many servings a day ? because you can t eat too much because it ll raise your cholesterol i know but when i do eat cheese i eat cheese you know if i put it on a sandwich it s like two or three pieces okay so that would be about one serving i think so you really ? you need to make sure you re getting at least uh you know milligrams of calcium i you know my mother gave me calcium pills for some reason she didn t want it i haven t taken them and units of vitamin d maybe you want to set it by the medications that you use the prescription ones so that way you ll remember it or maybe yeah i never forget my prescription so or maybe use like a pill box so you can put them in once a week yeah i should get one of those
so you can remember you know to do it uh you re still taking lipitor ? no i changed it to zocor last time oh yeah but you know what happened doctor ? mm hmm i got the numbers in the mail and i decided to stick with the lipitor so then when i called in for a refill i explained the whole thing to them uh huh that i wanted to stay with lipitor and not zocor so that s what i ve been getting so you ve been getting milligrams of the lipitor ? my numbers have the last time i had the blood work my numbers were good
okay let s see your tetanus shot was in so you re good for that did you get your colonoscopy last time that we talked about ? not quite yet but i m talking to my daughter in law she works she does these colonoscopies mm hmm so i talked to her about it last night so i says well i think you should do that i know i i do you know you re you should get it done by the age of and colon colon cancer is the second leading cause for death so you know if found early you can treat it and the treatment is relatively simple well i was asking her last night because we were over there it usually doesn t cause symptoms until the very end so you can t wait for symptoms to happen before you do it well i never have any kind of like blood or anything i never have any symptoms to tell you the truth and you don t have it you know until it s too late until it s too late by the time the you know cancer causes the symptoms it s kind of too late well what would i look for for symptoms ? well pretty much change in bowel habits blood in the stool weight loss unexplained weight loss oh weight loss i could take uh i have but not not not by getting cancer believe me i have never had what i would call normal bowel movements mm hmm i mean some days it could be five times i go mm hmm and maybe the next day one time mm hmm and this has been since i have been in my mid s so i i always think i had a little bit of irritable bowel syndrome so i think right but you know you can t say that unless you actually get the colonoscopy done and you know the structure is normal so i know you re big on the colonoscopy yeah let s see you re due for your pap smear and mammogram
is due you had it done in january last year and you have you eaten today ? so that s what was in january have you eaten in have you eaten today ? no i haven t eaten today so we ll do your blood work do my blood work yeah
you ve had your eye exam this year ? i never get an eye exam i go to target and buy the dollar eyeglasses because i break them so fast how is your distance vision ? i mean is that okay ? my i need them you just have trouble reading ? for reading for far i m good okay okay but i should go have one but you should get your pressure and everything checked and they can also check for like you know macular degeneration and things like that which are silent until until they re bad you know we don t really like our um our eyeglass provider it s we used to have the henry ford where we could go right over here mm hmm and we don t care for the if i could go to sears or penney s i don t really want to go to sears or penney s yeah let s see but that s all they offer us yeah let s see don t drive correct ? no not yet i m thinking about that too you might have to with my husband i know you might have to you think so ?
yeah it s going to become very difficult for you guys i know why do you say that ? because eventually i think you might he ll be wheelchair bound ? i keep him moving i don t know what he s doing but i keep him moving yeah and that is a good thing but you know i think it s a good thing to know yeah i know i know a good thing to do i have driven before so it s not like i have never driven mm hmm matter of fact i had a license up until about years ago mm hmm and i just decided i mean it really was anxiety maybe take some refresher courses oh i have to but now that you know your anxiety s a little bit better i think that ll just give you a little bit more uh freedom as well well that s true and you know when he s feeling poorly you know i still we still make a point to go together uh huh because if we didn t mm hmm we don t watch television together in the evening you know he s in his basement and i m upstairs in my little room so i mean by doing that at least we have that time together some time together
i no i have my kids my sister in laws have been you know mentioning about the driving and it s like oh
let s see any new medical problems in your family ? any new medical problems ? no nothing just that we have all had this awful flu but we think we caught it from our grandson who goes to daycare okay what and my son had was it ? like a stuffy nose runny nose and coughing and that kind of a thing ? well mine will be two weeks on thursday i came down with this raspy throat okay ? and then the next day which was friday i was flat in bed mm hmm i had a fever mm hmm i was in bed all day couldn t eat didn t have any energy very lethargic uh the next day i was in bed pretty much the whole day mm hmm and it was mainly the you know the runny nose the coughing mm hmm bad coughing and a lot of phlegm and mucus it was awful and it s taken this long and i all the way here i m still you know but i was really good about getting the mucus out mm hmm so that it didn t go in but uh i know they don t want you to come for the flu but i was pretty close to coming but i did it on my own but it s getting better though ? and i had a flu shot well i think that what you caught was probably a cold a cold ? a flu yeah a flu uh flu is typically like four five to six days of high fever shaking chills and no other symptoms you will usually not have like a runny nose stuffy nose or cough or anything with uh uh flu well i had the chills so influenza is pretty much different from the common cold uh huh and people tend to put everything in one package anything any illness in the um in this time frame from december to march everybody calls it flu but flu typically is influenza which is totally different from the other stomach viruses and well you know i couldn t function respiratory viruses i really had a hard time functioning usually when i get a cold at least you can still function but i had to sleep almost every day yeah yeah a lot of people have been sick so
okay let me just examine you ? thank you do you think my husband s getting worse ? well parkinson s is a progressive disease i know so i mean slowly but steadily it s going to happen i mean there is no cure for it it s a shame especially if he starts losing balance falling you know those kind of things then you you might have to take over some i know he is freaking me out i m going to get blood pressure i can tell he is because i can t really talk too much about i know you know his personal thing but you know i know but he likes to fish which is fine with me okay ? but he goes in a boat and he stands up in the boat and that freaks me out i cannot get through to him you cannot do that take somebody with you ice fishing ? he goes ice fishing ? no not ice fishing no he just goes that that would scare me too
summer fishing well i put my life jacket on when i m standing up and i said you probably do not if i know him he doesn t i have the hearing aids in is that
if you could just take them out it s so small i can barely see it do you want me to take both of them out ? i can barely see it i wasn t going to put them in but i figured i ll keep going huh ? it s better to hear your well it was a shocker you know i m just going to leave them here so remind me to take them i had two q tips in my ears for three months oh wow this one so i had my hearing is still bad open your mouth say ah
do you still have your grandson with you ? no he goes to daycare and we take care of him when he you know is sick that s why we get sick just make sure you have like a lot of hand sanitizer around the place and wash your hands i got so sick and tired of using those wipes all over the place disinfecting
hold your breath for a second breathe normally nice deep breath in and out okay go ahead and lay down do you exercise at all ? no i used to but i don t anymore but i have to say i am a very active person ask my husband you know i m all over the place i can t sit during the day because if i sit i ll fall asleep put your arms above your head so i can do a breast exam okay i do wish i could lose weight the other day i was watching qvc on sunday and i said how about if i get nutrisystem ? well i think you can just do it with regular food how about something like weight watchers ? that i my sister just joined that and i don t know that it s just regular food you just need to learn how to ration out your food right right and eat i my problem is carbs i love bread i m like my father was you know i got to have my bread you can have your bread as long as it s not over doing it right yeah i don t think i over do it now i don t believe in like atkins and you know those kind of things either what ? believe in what ? atkins or you know those kinds of diets where you oh atkins completely go off of carbs i don t believe in that no no i think deep breath in and out excuse me ? deep breath one more time i uh you have to learn how to eat right and how to have portion control there s no doubt about that so it seems like one day you can do it the next day you can t it takes days to break a habit twenty one ? you know i don t eat nearly and six months to keep it off i don t eat chocolate like i used to i don t have the taste for it anymore uh huh which was surprising to me but that s been for a while now go ahead and put your feet up in here and scoot down all the way to the edge of the table okay but i m under a lot of stress all the time with my husband you know you never know when he wakes up in the morning how he s going to be although he tries hard
yeah come down pull your your bottom has to be at the edge of the table down give me the cramp in my leg like this okay that s the maximum i can i don t want to fall off here no you won t fall off that s yet to happen i ll be the first one more ? yeah that s fine that s fine ? that s fine never lost a patient on the floor while doing a pap smear so oh gosh
you have four kids right ? excuse me ? four children ? four children yes one s still living at home i don t know if he s ever going to move out he s but if he can t afford it i don t want him to go mm hmm you know he s still he s better than what he was but he s still not where he should be for his age he s single ? he s single yeah he wants to be a police officer in the worst way mm hmm that s what he wants to do and um he does not have a degree he just started back at college again but he s he wasted so many years we just stopped telling him he had to learn you know when it was time to do it on his own what does he do ? uh he works you know i really don t know the name of the company but he it s a call center oh okay and then he works part time mm hmm it s not like he s totally lazy he works part time at a a a pub mm hmm so you know he s gone from the house quite a bit because he s working but he really wants to be a police officer matter of fact he went down about three weeks ago to detroit mm hmm and as a last resort and he applied over there he s got a lot of friends from working at this bar mm hmm people that he knows of and stuff like that but they re supposed to have a mass hiring now in detroit i m not crazy about the idea but it s his life go ahead and scoot back and sit up well if that s what he wants to do that s what he wants to do so i ll just be quiet about it it s a good you know i mean put these back in before i forget don t forget your hearing aids yeah oh
okay so pretty much we ll draw the blood work i ll give you the order for the mammogram i did your pap smear
did we do a bone density in the last couple of years ? so i think we should do i m going to do that i think if i i ve had one before but that was maybe ten years ago yeah and make sure you do the colonoscopy this time okay ? doctor give me the stuff i ll i m i m asking my daughter in law exactly how this works uh huh you ll be out for it so it s really not that bad well i don t need my daughter in law seeing my butt that s for sure is she a doctor ? no she s she s a nurse ? just one of these technicians that uh she went to school for a couple of years i guess does she work at lakeside ? she works at lakeside oh okay in colonoscopy oh okay okay so she should have the back door to get you in she said i ll get you she says i know what doctor to give you know get you to and everything so uh yeah yeah think about it i said okay one other thing would be uh you re so we need to talk about the shingles vaccine okay i don t have a problem i ll get it um basically it s do you know what shingles is ? uh yes because my husband had it up here okay and you you know it can be very painful and it can last for months together ? that s what i heard and anybody who has had chicken pox as a child or has been exposed to it they have the virus in their body and when you get older your immune system goes down and then you get a flare up and it s not like childhood chicken pox where it s like for a week rash little fever and gone this is very painful and lasts for months so the vaccine is basically like a live viral vaccine which boosts your immune system to keep the immunity up against the uh virus and keep it suppressed yeah i don t have a so i ll order it i can t give it to you today but i have to order it it goes to the pharmacy the pharmacy calls your insurance to verify if they ll pay or not and then they will call you so you make an appointment to get the actual vaccine just with the nurse okay okay ?
so those are the few things yeah my husband finally had his he kept forgetting about it yeah and you need your prescriptions right ? just the cozaar ? i have just the cozaar i mean the other ones i ll i i think i have them for a couple of months maybe i ll have come back you can come back in if you would give me a day yeah mm hmm i only have to pay the two co pays instead of three and this is going to the rite aid ? yes on road i ll mail out your results as they become available okay ?
okay so somebody will be in with your paperwork okay ? okay great you take care i ll see you back six months or as needed ? i usually come once a year ? okay just because if i m not feeling you know if if nothing s bothering me i don t want to spend the money on anything you know really i mean with my husband we are just the prescriptions this year because they changed it the plan he was on salary and uh like for his parkinson s medication requip is dollars for one month mm hmm yeah and even my um like lipitor will be dollars a month mm hmm for me so yeah yeah we do put out quite a bit of money on prescriptions and that and it s only going to get worse every year because the way they changed the plan we have to pick up the excess cost every year so if you know if well if there s a problem you know where to find me yes if i m sick i will be here i m not going to you know let anything go by the wayside yeah alright you take care bye bye bye bye nice seeing you nice seeing you and i ll be here when you come out

now your potassium on the other hand was low and that s why we put you on the potassium yeah and i did use that up alright and but i haven t been taking it lately okay well um now so the reason your potassium was low is you know you re on the water pill mm hmm and so that that low potassium rains you drains you out can continue uh so you would stay on the potassium long term uh the uh uh your blood pressure was high when you were here last time which was again was a little a little over a year ago and uh that s why i put you on the labetalol to try to uh improve that did what does that do that the other ones don t ? well it it works by a little different mechanism uh what what we do with uh blood pressure is you know and different medications we try to use medications that uh work differently so the sum effect will be to control the blood pressure so i ve got four now you have four now right right uh but of course you ve had you ve had uh i know i know pretty chronically high blood pressure since uh you know since you were diagnosed so i ll i ll see what it is and we can look at that now you uh you turned

sure where is the pain usually at when you take the darvocet ? all over that s for my fibromyalgia that s what i take it for when it gets really bad
any family history of any kind of diseases ? nope my mother did die of leukemia but i think that was a disease of opportunity she was an alcoholic for years kind of ran herself down

okay i usually bring you a copy but i i didn t feel like it today i know you re just not feeling well and i want you to go home drink plenty of fluids and rest when your like i said i ve been actually drinking water good that s good for you i know but i hate water because as you uh as you have this infection you re going to use up more water so i do want you to take water well that s why i crave water so much that i drink it and i don t want your fibro that s what my son finally was convinced that i was sick when i told him i was drinking water
and i don t want your fibromyalgia to act up now that you re sick okay ? no i haven t looked at the barometer but it must be pretty good cause i haven t had too much with it and if i push on myself i can tell it hurts but it hasn t been aching ahh mmm yeah he s the foot doctor said this new uh anti inflammatory he thinks if it works for me it ll be better than the naproxen is that right ? yeah it starts with a v my husband just put it over there to get it filled the first fill valtrex ? is that it ? sound familiar ? you think he s right ? well the valtrex is used if you have shingles what is he giving it to you for ? if that s what it is it starts with a v anything else starts with a v ? oh there s a whole bunch that starts with a v hmm anti inflammatory ? what what is he voltaren voltaren then there you go that s what they like using that the voltaren you like using it ? the podiatrists like using it podiatrists they say it works well with the feet so i hope i m not defeated yeah my feet got so skinny i found a toe that big there s something wrong with it cause it looks like i got a tiny case of elephantitis oh really ?
yeah usually i m just swollen some sort of inflammation i got back the reason i went to the foot doctor i got back that rash i had that last year where was that rash at ? on my feet on the top and the bottom ? on the top what did he say it was ? he didn t know but i said i think i figured it out i think it s my red winter slippers he said it probably is a reaction to red dye could be i used to have this i call it my september rash when i lived in rome my right hand would get a rash every september he couldn t figure out what was wrong what was doing that either but after i moved away it went away so it must be something that grows in rome more than anyplace else could be
you having a good time ? yeah i m doing fine thanks
and i are going on um nutrisystem oh good we re going to try that we got the food ut neither one of us has really felt like eating much he still has a cough and a drip i ve been so cold and clammy i want you to get plenty of rest take some tylenol for aches and pains take your medicine i can t take aspirin ? it s not a well you can but i prefer tylenol why ? because it reduces the risk of having any kind of problems with your stomach like gi bleeding and upset stomach okay ? i don t like tylenol well if you want if you take an aspirin too once in awhile that s not bad you can do that and i have your lab work here you can go make the appointment i ve called in your uh prescriptions to walgreen the antibiotic you take two today and one a day for four days and the cough syrup as needed and let me k i hope you gave me a big bottle of that cough syrup yes i did i gave you six ounces that s what you gave me last time no i gave you four last time oh okay and uh let me get you your list of your medicines so you can have it okay ? do you have any questions i can answer for you ? no i don t well think of and if you do and let me know if you re not any better uh you know i was having problems with breathing before this all happened you didn t find anything wrong ? your lungs sound crystal clear like a bell you think i m having anxiety attacks then ? could be might a little bit with being sick once you feel better from your infection you should feel better overall okay ? alright dear i ll try to have the same hope you do and then i ll bring you that list of your medicines okay ?
can i get in there to wash my hands ? i m sorry are you about done or do you need to see me after ? um well after in the waiting room i just have a quick uh five minute survey for you to fill out then i give you your gift card and everything
you ve got some nasty cough there you know that ? it was worse let me get you your list it s nothing compared to last week be right back call me if you re not any better okay ? bye bye well that was something that s the first time i had the flu since is that right ? yeah i had the hong kong flu back then but there s a
can i come in ? hello ! hi how are you ? oh i m fine thank you okay let me just wash my hands so i hear the good news those breast lump things were fine huh ?
yeah but that was a that was a scare that was a scare i agree uh and i had to wait a whole week mm hmm before i found out before they got the results ? between the biopsy and the doctor s visit uh huh okay it was probably one of the most hardest hardest things yeah and so you do know about the follow up now ? you re clear about like when to go back ? yeah you sent me something in the mail yep yep but i haven t done anything because we just got back from vacation last night alright well how was it ? the vacation ? wonderful wonderful good good they want you know like a six month follow up so just look at the letter it has the instructions on there although they are not worried about any cancer or anything no because it was just i think like a little cyst because as she mm hmm went in there the biopsy it already kind of disappeared uh huh but uh yeah sometimes it s a cyst with the cheesy stuff in it and it can just kind of melt away so they didn t find much and i m glad about that how are you doing ? oh i m doing very well okay and the do you ever get a chance to check your blood pressure at home ? well actually it s very good here today did you read it ? okay it is high it s yeah but the yeah the the bottom number i used to have like when i walked in here yes yes yes but it s so i m doing no i m doing pretty good with my blood pressure alright now it says i need to restart milligrams or milligrams for pain is it ? oh neuralgia pain on the right side of the face oh nine years ago i had a very big neuralgia problem on the right side of my face mm hmm and i i took elavil mm hmm and i always had enough to take but the last few months i haven t taken anything and if i overuse my right arm i can tell so i thought if i take one in the morning uh yeah a milligram if that is acceptable with you ? that that is fine i thought you were on it but no i m not on it no i ran out and i never that s no problem because you know i do not take any medication unless i really have to okay because that has been listed as one of the medicines that oh okay okay so you will give me no problem okay very good thank you i ll be happy to do that now the other things that we need to go over you know this is your visit for your health maintenance um your weight has been
i know yeah let s see better than before but a little worse again i mean in november you were you were weighing more than this and then you lost a couple of pounds and you ve gained a couple again i ve been fighting a weight problem for years so i it s okay alright and as long as i don t get so fat that mm hmm people turn around and look at me and say look at that person mm hmm so i mean but i am trying and i can take ten pounds off but the thing is a month or two later it s back again so i ve yeah it s kind of it s just it s been a lifelong battle
uh huh your last physical you were more like most of the time i would be seeing you for i know i really didn t have i really don t have physicals for blood pressure checks yeah i know i really don t have physicals because i uh huh hate going to the doctor i know your blood pressure goes up too i know i know
are you are you seeing the behavioral services doctor anymore ? dr n well i did that for a while but then i guess my my time ran out and i never restarted it and i mean i know everything but you were that was quite helpful wasn t it ? it was very helpful but okay you ll think about it huh ? you mean i if you need to go back to her or not no ? you re doing okay as far as your i think so
stress and anxiety and ? okay um now have we talked about because you ve never come to me for a physical as such about the colon cancer screening ? well i always get a a you know a stool card okay yeah the stool stool stool cards are also very helpful they can kind of hint a little bit about uh they they are helpful in just telling us if there is any bleeding anywhere and that bleeding can be like up from here to the stomach to the intestines to way down so
i know but i think i told you once that i have a colon um yes you have a spastic colon ? and and and if it acts up the pain is as bad as labor pain mm hmm so if i have one of those tests i have to take a laxative mm hmm i m going to be in so much pain mm hmm that s that s why i have resisted having one of those things mm hmm have you have you ever tried having one ? because um they do it a little different nowadays it used to be but i have to take all this laxative yeah you can take your laxative you have to take the laxative to clean up i know but this this is when i have diarrhea it is so painful it s like it s like labor pain it s so bad when ? when i you know when you take the laxative and you go to the bathroom and you have diarrhea uh huh and then and then the stomach pain i mean it is incredible so why did you have to take the laxatives ? because to to clean out the colon so they can go and check it right ? so that s what i was asking have you ever tried going for that test ? i had i had this done some years ago when they thought i had the stomach problem but then they that s what they said i had a colon when they did that test and i mean colon really doesn t have any symptoms i mean any mm hmm it s just that my yeah because of sometimes because of anxiety or stress or because yeah this is me and foods the colon goes into it seems like my colon is the weakest part of my body so that s the one that goes in horrendous spasms
well the stool cards can help a little bit like i said but but i know i know they they are not really indicative if they they can come back negative because the bleeding can be at certain times and not at other times so you may send a stool card or do a stool card at a time when there s no bleeding and the colonoscopy we do recommend is more like you directly look at the colon i know my husband has it done every five years oh okay alright and you are now ? okay yep you and what about the pap smear ? although in my opinion you don t you don t need those anymore what ? the pap smears i mean we can still do a pelvic exam to make sure your ovaries are fine and there s nothing there you don t need a pap smear anymore ? no no on pap smear we specifically do it to screen for cervical cancer cervical cancer is mostly transmitted through a virus called hpv virus or human papilloma virus right i know i know and that is a sexually transmitted disease so if a person is not you know like is sexually active just with one person and has had normal paps all their life never an abnormal pap smear i had one abnormal pap smear we don t need pap smears anymore i don t know that i just know that most of my friends still have pap smears we could do one you know well i don t know if i should have one i don t know well the last time you had one was uh november of so that s two years ago it was fine yeah but you know it s been two years well if you don t mind for my peace of mind unless you say it s absolutely not necessary no we we will do it if it s and then we can you know decide i don t think if it comes back normal this year you don t need one next year okay okay as far as your immunizations you still don t want your pneumonia vaccine ? okay i don t even get a cold i never had a cold in my life i never had pneumonia so and i m so funny when it comes to medication i just don t want to do it unless i have to
you had some blood work done in august was this a part of your physical just now that they sent you ? okay maybe it was no i had some blood work done um a week ago because you sent me a letter okay okay okay i m supposed to have some done before i see you yeah so this is good now we have the blood work
i ll go over it with you your sugar is a little bit high yeah i kind of figured on that that sooner or later i would yeah you have had borderline diabetes for a while but you are doing good is almost very well controlled almost close to the normal so if you are watching your diet i would not put you on a medicine yet well what what can i do to watch my diet even more ? uh stop anything with sugar in it like sweets candies cookies pop with sugar in it stop the sugar in your coffee or tea uh ? that even includes bread and stuff ? yes uh you just go down on the amount you don t stop all the way and i would suggest you could if it would be very good if you make an appointment with our nurses here who do the diabetic teaching and they will explain a lot more like how much calories would be for your activities and it s it s not that you just cut out the sugars all the way you just take them in moderate amount and it should be all balanced this is probably pounds overweight that i m yeah that is that definitely helps once you lose weight your sugar will go down automatically and your cholesterol um the total is still high it s been like this all my life my mother mm hmm who s going to have a birthday next week and she ll turn mm hmm she can run up and down the basement stairs times her cholesterol is around so it is it is genetic yes it is genetic most of the cholesterol are a combination of genetics and diet although you have done something to your diet that it has gone down from the bad cholesterol of the ldl has gone down from to so it did work then a little yes it did well i m watching if you go a little bit more you might hit the normal which would be but with your high blood pressure the combination of high cholesterol and high blood pressure and borderline diabetes just puts you at a high risk for heart disease so that s why we are a little more pushy in that a person should take a little bit of cholesterol lowering medication see i have a year old son who s a marathon runner in tip top shape mm hmm and his cholesterol is high and it s because of his mother and his grandmother that is that is and you are right in saying that and he s eating i mean perfectly but except for your for your mom who is doing well uh the thing is high cholesterol is again like a painless condition i know i know the only time a person really suffers is when they get the heart attack or the stroke i know i know i know so you know yes you may not feel that your arteries are clogged i know unless something really happens i m going to check your eyes ears nose throat
and then pap smear too i ll give you a copy of your results
and say ah any problem with hearing or vision or ?
okay any dizziness ? shortness of breath ? chest pain ? no no stomach pains ? joint pains ? i m just asking while i m no no joint pains while i m checking you back problems ? any skin moles that are bothering you ? well i i have one here these these are just like skin tags but this one i sometimes just scratch off of that it bleeds badly it s almost like a little wart you can come in some other time and i can just freeze it or you can see the dermatologist no i d rather and get like a whole mole check of the whole body oh okay
take a deep breath so after the surgery your back is doing good ? just lay down please lay down ?
how about your veins ? are they do they bother you ? my what ? the veins no it s just i m getting upset about this one here mm hmm you know i had this one up here already when i was years old uh huh so i ve had this vein up here for years within the last two or three years it went further yeah that happens you ll the more you stand the valves become more but it doesn t hurt it just looks ugly when i wear shorts i mean do i need to do something ? i mean can i uh you you can wear those uh no i m not going to well then if they re not bothering you then it s not dangerous no they are not indicative of the blood clots that you are uh associated with a dangerous thing but if they get they can get inflamed they can bleed you can develop ulcers the ankles and the feet can get like black spots and um sometimes the feet can swell no i don t have any problems with that so just watch for those things and if that happens then just put your arms up like that i just worry about my hernia sometimes and your hernia is where ? put your hands on your chest and try and pick up alright i see yeah i know now there s a little scar under your belly button is that like tubal ligation or ? no no uh uh they removed a they removed something from my ovaries ? no ? yeah it was it was a not a blister a a cyst ? a cyst ! yeah they went through there but that s been years ? oh more than years ago more than years ago okay alright i ll be right back hi ms with me that would like to just to see how we do pap smears is that okay if she accompanies us as well ? oh sure alrighty thank you very much oh you re welcome i ll be right back okay hopefully the pap smear won t be any problem we have done it before and i have with me they can pass me things so i don t have to have you in the stirrups for a long time longer than necessary okay ? alright thank you with my hernia mm hmm when will i know if i m in trouble with that ?
if it starts to swell by on it s own if it becomes sore or painful okay just move down until you feel my hand touching you oh oh ! i m sorry i just had a cramp the way i moved down i had a cramp yeah that can happen i m sorry no that s okay once a while i get a cramp like especially when i m in bed and then i jump mm hmm
okay okay am i further am i enough down or ? i d better go down yeah bit more yeah okay oh my goodness i m sorry ladies no no that s okay no you re fine although i just move down a little bit more okay and do it like together don t no i have to i still can feel how sore it is okay i m just going to okay is that enough now ? uh let s see if we can do it this way otherwise it might be we might need you to come down is that enough now ?
yeah okay and if this pap is fine i think you can stop getting the pap smears okay well i didn t know i yeah those are the newer recommendations you know because my mom is and she still gets a pap smear yeah the doctors keep on doing it because and she s at with the henry ford system well when they patients say they want it we don t refuse okay ? so but we have to tell them that you know it s not something that s really now medically indicative okay you can scoot back we ll give you the stool cards to take home and then we ll see how things are okay ? alright any other questions ?
okay alright okay it s over just relax thank you ms you re welcome thank you now if i were a good patient for you when would you want to see me again ? uh for your blood pressure i m still not happy although you are happy i know oh i m very happy i mean ! yeah do you have to see the uh kidney doctor ? that you know of ? the kidney doctor ? mm hmm no why ? you saw the nephrologists remember you have a kidney problem too ? let me check on that that was nine years ago nine years ago but with the blood pressure and all that let me see if they wanted to see you back i really don t want to go unless you think i have a problem but i just don t want to go okay let me see if there was anything they could do different to help us i think my blood pressure is my personality too some of it my mom has high blood pressure but you know personalities are personalities or type a personalities don t cause blood pressure they make the blood pressure worse so i know i know i m anxious i worry i m a planner but this is who i am um but i made it that far and in pretty good shape i mean i can run i can work i i work twice a week i take care of four children cook breakfast lunch and dinner so i have i have energy i have boundless energy mm hmm i feel fine mm hmm i have no joint pain no back pain yeah so why fix things that are not broken ? right so i mean it s just always my blood pressure it s always my cholesterol and it s always my weight and it s been like this for the last years yeah i think we have talked about you had an ultrasound and a ct scan of your kidneys and there are you know like old scars and stuff right right that might be the cause for your blood pressure actually because as as a young girl i had i don t know probably half a dozen or more kidney infections but it was like years ago years ago when that s why yeah well anyways so that is the the reason probably for your blood pressure along with the personality and with yeah
but this is my personality i mean this is who i am and i try very hard mm hmm instead of cleaning certain things every week i do it on a biweekly basis mm hmm so i try to train myself to be a little more but even here i didn t sleep very well last night i already had diarrhea this morning and i know you and i like you very much thank you but still still you are a little stressed out

and uh any problems any concerns ? no i went for my knees mm hmm and um they said they were gonna send you they were severe um they both need replacement i m in therapy right now and how s that going ? actually it s going pretty good i actually uh rode a bike and i went all the way around i didn t couldn t believe i couldn t ride a bike and get my knee to go around and um i ve done it twice already so i go twice a week mm hmm and um that s come along real good the stretching feels really good so okay uh is the pain better with all that ? i still have to the pain um i think it is mm hmm but i still have to tell myself to bend my knee when i walk so um and you are taking something for pain ? yes you gave me some darvocets mm hmm and you said to take em three times a day but i can t function on that at three times a day so i just take em once before i it s only as needed so go to bed what about the naprosyn ? i take that in the morning i m usually take one in the morning and then depending on how i am in the afternoon i ll either take that or i ll take um a tylenol arthritis okay and um you blood pressure s pretty okay and a little bit water mm hmm but it s not bad um any other problems other than your knees ? no just you know i i did want last time i too i meant to forget i think i have arthritis or bursitis i don t know in my shoulders and neck and right here this is so strange i never had shoulder problems in november mm hmm ah the last weekend in november or the first weekend in december i went to employee health got my tb shot got a vaccination mm hmm no tb and the flu i came back got the tb they gave me a tetanus mm hmm i have had pain in this shoulder ever since that was in ? november of ? it was the very end of november or the very first week of or ? just this year and i have had pain in this shoulder ever since now i don t know if they so where does it hurt ? is it arm or it s like right in through here and through the joint and i don t know if it s like if they hit the muscle mm hmm and it just does it hurt when you lift your arm up ? it s like no i can lift it but sometimes it s really strange strange feels like a pulling ? yes and so i ll mm hmm start exercising with my weights mm hmm and just stretch it out because if it s the shoulder as such the joint you would have a hard time doing this this movement is okay so it could be like a muscle thing going on from the injection oh really ? that long ? i thought maybe it was just in my head unlikely for it to be that long but if uh there is like minor tear in that break in the muscle oh okay you have like inflammation you might need some exercising to get it out and i am left hand and i my hand s on the mouse all the time mm hmm so it s like in one position a lot too maybe a few things together maybe it was not just the injection but maybe it just made it things worse oh okay because you re on the computer quite a bit so it depends on the position of your arm and how much stretching you do okay and the same like that s what i m thinking this is across your upper back ? mm hmm back of the neck ? because i m always i m on the computer all day and that s the major problem with people who use the computer all the time these muscles get strained quite a bit so regular stretching exercising taking breaks ah while you re working i know that really helps because if you re not giving it a stretch going on for so many hours it ll take a toll on on your shoulders over the long run it s not a one day thing day after day mm hmm you ll start experiencing the pain i ll try to be more conscious of doing that yeah mm hmm like every hour mm hmm just stretch a little bit few minutes doesn t take much but it s how conscious you are are you listening to your body a lot ? are you just letting go okay i things start bothering you especially at this age because your body has gone through so many years of you need to take care okay ? and um the physical therapy is just for your knees right ? both knees ? mm hmm for both of em mm hmm and i am doing uh went back to weight watchers good mm hmm and uh so that s coming along pretty good ah when did you join weight watchers ? well i joined last august but then i stopped in november and i re signed back up mm hmm cause i need to lose because you do have with the weight watchers right ? right mm hmm you do lose weight with that do you gain all the weight back again oh from what you lost in the past ? no no i actually lost from november through now mm hmm i lost six pounds so okay good i went down six

no i think i m fine because you just gave me some uh last time i was here okay and no chest pain ? no tightness in your chest ? no sometimes i get palpitations but it s when at the end of the day when i m laying down or rest ready to go to bed mm hmm so and i think that s just stress mm hmm no difficulty breathing ? bowel movements are okay ? no blood in the stool ? no mm mm no constipation diarrhea nothing unusual ? no i m doing good
any in your legs ? no actually since i ve been on that alli they ve been excellent oh are you still taking it ? mm hmm mm hmm alli okay when did you start taking that ? what is this may ? oh okay so just started april i just got my second bottles mm hmm and there s a month ago so beginning of april mm hmm and uh do have any trouble like diarrhea no i m one day i thought i had the flu and i was in bed all day oh okay so it could have been i didn t know if it was the alli and i had been on it like a week and a half or if it actually was the flu cause i had the stomach cramps and everything so yeah mm hmm so i just let it go at that and stayed in bed and mm hmm but then after that i m fine i ve been just real doing real good mm hmm i know what to eat and i know what not to eat so i think it makes you lose weight that way too mm hmm because you re skipping something you eat right right right so but it s it s doing good mm hmm and um uh it it does it makes you more conscious of what you re eating so and let me put a on you tried in the past right ? it you gave me the prescription but the insurance wouldn t cover it oh yeah yeah no my daughter she had her doctor just gave her something oh crumb something else ? other than ? yeah so it s not meridia ? something to lose weight ? yes speaking with the as is there one with a a ? i think that yes i think that s it that s a appetite suppressant oh okay it s it can interact with your blood pressure medication alli but the appetite suppressants even though they re over the counter some of them yeah i don t take those i would i would never have any of that no i don t stick out your tongue aah
okay do you have trouble with allergies this time of the year ? usually but um mm hmm i m doing okay this year just a little congested uh actually last night yeah i can but i m doing okay
and you said to take um mm hmm but i haven t had to buy any yet so okay good take a few deep breaths in and out breathe normally hold your breath okay i want you to lie down so if you go to the gynecologist they ll do the breast exam so i ll skip that
when was your last period ? i think it was in having no spotting after that ?
did you ever have any abnormal pap smears before ? how long ago was that at ? did you have any biopsies anything done after that ? no mm mm they said just it s abnormal right right okay that s fine
and before they do the replacement they ask me to lose more pounds so i m working really hard at that okay you can sit up you can you can do that easily with the weight watchers you ll be able to lose weight with that okay good so how much weight did you lose since august of last year ? since you joined weight watchers initially ? about oh i know over okay good so they definitely are considering joint replacement ? yeah it s i have absolutely no cartilage on a lateral mm hmm and my patella femoral is like a half moon shape there was a word and i ripped it up real fast and i thought oh i know it and i didn t and i can t go back into my chart so and look it up um mm hmm and i the tech should i let you know if you want to because i forgot what it was i thought it began with a p and i but that s the patella femoral but right before that there was a word no i don t think it was condra but oh i don t think so this doesn t want to work i ll let you know i ll write it down on a piece of paper and give it to you but i know they were like they re severe both of em are really severe the same way and i just have little bit cartilage on the uh medial side
anyone in your family with arthritis ? my mom replacements ? no no replacements but mom s got really bad in her hands but no um do you because especially if it s in your family like your mom has it mm hmm you can develop oh yeah yeah you can yeah she does
maybe that s one more reason to lose the weight but today let me go ahead and order for a ekg
okay she did that already oh she s quick today huh ? okay let me look into that i don t have it right here and uh the colonoscopy i ll just give you the form okay ?
okay alright you can make an appointment later uh and uh the pap smear make sure you have that done and are you taking any calcium with vitamin d ? mm hmm calcium d okay how many times ? i take it twice a day okay good that s good and then i take a multiple vitamin that s good so everything is pretty good if you re having the joint replacement i ll i ll see you just before the surgery for clearance but otherwise um i can see you in like six months that everything is fine okay ? thank you very much anything else today ? no i m doing good thank you you too okay you can dressed after okay alright now do i see you anymore ? i do have a few questions

okay ? um medications do you take any medications on a regular basis ? well you ve been here before it s just been awhile huh ? so you re not taking the robaxin anymore ? do you just take it as needed ? okay what about vicodin ? just as needed ? okay and then uh naproxen ? you don t take that one at all ?
no i just been taking the vicodin okay alright and what do you take the vicodin for ? the shoulder left shoulder left shoulder pain ? yeah can t and i have no reach oh you re seeing ortho for that ? yes i m in therapy at the college
you know what ? you had a physical this year that s what i thought yeah you did sorry about that you had one in um you had one in september so if i do a physical today that would be not a good thing
um let me see if there s anything to follow up on though well your shoulder you ve been seeing ortho for which shoulder again your right ? it was my right five years ago they surgery ? yeah no they didn t do surgery i went to uh they didn t surgery ? therapy and healed it on my own okay and now this time you re not having as much luck ? now i fell down and and i hurt my left shoulder fell on the cement hit my shoulder in the in the basement when did you do that ? oh probably about three months ago and i ve been having problems with it so the last two two weeks i ve been trying to get it taken care of and you re right handed right ? so are you in physical therapy right now ? i went today it was my second time i m scheduled for six to eight weeks twice a week okay so they re thinking about maybe doing uh injection with steroids and that kind of thing ? yeah i m hoping not but right i don t blame you i m trying to avoid that and then they thought maybe an ultrasound so they re they re kind of handling that right ? okay so we don t i don t want to mess up what they re doing um but let me see what i said in my physical last time you were here
right i thought i just had one you did you had one in september and i apologize that you are here today thinking the same thing um well the only thing i didn t get from you last time was a fasting cholesterol and i i m assuming you ate today cholesterol test ? did you eat ? i ate um probably around noon just a ham with a okay no that would make the that would make the test bad okay i know you got the shoulder x ray which probably didn t show a whole lot but i got both of them now and you re uh let's see well your sugar could be rechecked cause it was a little bit high when you were here in september so that s not a bad thing to recheck so let s let s do that cause it s been over six months you know the only thing i can get since i don't know if you ll come back to give me a fasting cholesterol get a total today but that s not going to include the bad and it s not going to include the good it s just the total what is that now ? cholesterol ? uh huh i really need you to fast for for the whole thing but i m just going to get the total today because you re here and we re going to get blood on you anyways so but if you can come back sometime for a fasting cholesterol ?
where s your wife ? maybe i should tell her that huh ? she ll get you back in here right ? she s at home with the granddaughter oh yeah ? how old s your granddaughter ?
are you guys enjoying this weather ? oh yeah it will be nice for it to dry up for memorial it s so wet out there is it still wet ? oh in the woods it is up north you know oh where are you ? oh no i m i go to the area where s that ? seven it s like mile and vandyke oh way out there it s not too far it s only maybe minutes from here okay so like up in it s not um it s just a little north of the palace actually oh okay that s not too bad oh okay yup i know where oxford it s only five miles from oxford okay that s where you live ? no that s just that s where you visit ? that s where we go on the weekends to the lake the little family gathering i got an uncle that lives out there and a cousin i got three younger sisters and one cabin next door just a summer summer fun place oh good with a lot of cutting grass i was out there yesterday and did some work with my bad left arm my son was there helping but i can t stop using it no i understand it s hard for me to relax only been i retired a year now you ve been retired a year ? what d you retire from ? from chrysler down river trenton engine are they is that still open ? the minivan motors is that still open ? is it ? that s good yeah they re still selling them minivans yeah mammas love minivans
okay so other than the shoulder nothing i can do for you huh ? except you need to just give me the cholesterol oh and last time i asked you about colon cancer screening colonoscopy ? what d you say about that ? what ? um about the colon cancer screening ? colonoscopy ? do you remember me asking about that ? yeah what everything s fine well no it s recommended after the age of that you get a colonoscopy for colon didn t i just have one ? like actually go to gi and get one done ? it s where they stick a tube in your bottom and look at the whole colon ? no i didn t do that one yeah no i was thinking you probably didn t um but that s what recommended is it something that you uh i don t favor it no um it s what s recommended so if you re not going to do that usually what i do um is i get um what s called hemoccult cards uh huh and that checks for um blood in your stool you have to take them home and do them then and then mail them back that s fine you ll try that ? i still do recommend the colonoscopy that is better that is a better uh detection for colon cancer but we ll do that for right now and what about do you remember when your last tetanus shot was ? um no i don t are you interested in getting that updated today ? really ? how come ? i ve been pretty pretty good so yeah but it s to protect you against uh having like lockjaw and have you cut yourself or anything ? no i i always get bumps and scraps but yeah so you don t want to it heals up right away well i know but do you you re not interested i m good my nails grow like pchew i think i ve cut these things every three days okay so you don t want to get the tetanus shot then ? you got the flu shot cause i m trying to slow down cause of this left arm okay you got the flu shot last time though did i ? mm hmm did your wife talk you into that or did i ? i don't know
just breathe normally okay big breath in and out one more
okay so other than your arm you re feeling good ? okay how about the chest x ray ? do you think you want to get that done for me ? the chest x ray ? mm hmm when would that have to be done ? whenever you know within the next month or so alright i can do that
and how much are you smoking ? roughly ? over about a pack a day pack a day under a pack
okay and alcohol do you drink ? not when i m taking these uh pain pills no ? okay but normally drink a couple two three times a week ? and usually three four beers at a time ? okay and no drugs marijuana cocaine heroin right ?
okay okay alright so you ll get the chest x ray for me you know smoking it s a good idea to quit
okay not interested in quitting at this time then ? especially the prices eh ? well no kidding yeah it d be extra money in your pocket you ll probably save a lot of money a year let's see what are they five bucks a pack ? so you smoke a pack a day ? you want me to do the math for you ? you want me to tell you how much you d save a year ? no i i believe it i do believe it s a lot of money it s in the thousands so a pack a day so let s say it s five five times seven for a week so it s a week thirty five times weeks in a year that s a lot of money isn t it ? mm hmm up in smoke literally i know it s a habit but you got to be want wil ready to quit
so when you are you let us know okay here s the order form for the chest x ray um make sure you come back for a fasting cholesterol cause that s one of the ones i don t have on you nothing to eat or drink for ten to hours actually excuse me nothing to eat or drink for hours you can drink water but oth do you drink coffee ? do you drink it black ? if i have to okay you can have coffee black but those are the only things you can have for the cholesterol test otherwise i am going to get some blood work today cause your sugar was a little bit borderline last time do you remember me telling you about that ?
okay um and i d say you d have to lose weight and exercise but for you weight loss doesn t look like it s an issue i m over but that s my normal weight was like i m up to almost oh i know but i mean it s there s not a whole lot to lose on you so the only thing that i would suggest other than other than that is just changing your diet a little bit watching the white foods um trying to switch from like white pastas to whole grain pastas from white rice to brown rice those are simple things you can do um walking daily even if it s just minutes a day that ll help so those sort of things okay ?
anything else ? okay well stay put they re going to come in and draw some blood and then uh you actually are technically due for a physical in after september th so you can can relay that on okay ? alright well i hope your shoulder gets better
you know that remember when i was having problems with my hip ? i vaguely remember that that wallet worked if i pulled that wallet out oh really ? and it really worked so you took it out and you were good ? i wish everything worked that well well good i m glad you well you know i was still a little sore but it took a little while to heal up well i m sure it ended to be fine
okay well you can go ahead and get dressed as long as they can get to your arm to get some blood okay ? thank you ight you take care you too

did you get to shop in the internet ? no like i have the time to go on the computer even you know it s horrible i don t even get to do that so i can t wait for no i i you know i won t say that i hate for them to grow up fast too you know my kids no because even then you re going to get more demanding teachers are more demanding than little ones yeah really ? i was thinking actually i ll get more time to do like watch my tv programs or go on the computer then no no see there s no didn t have it like that maybe it will with you didn t happen like that for me no ? did they go come back or they leave ? you re always driving them some somewhere they re into something you re always taking then you have their friends over right right i was the cool aid mom so i always had the kids at the house right yeah you know can you believe it i m stuck on every friday evening in gymnastics from until i m just there sitting you know and maybe it s good for me because i don t get to do anything else but i don t have a laptop so you know i don t you ve at least got to get a laptop or a good book yeah so it s that s what i do because they both do gymnastics and it s almost like one after another do they travel ? mm mm they re not old enough to travel yet see you ve got fun coming yeah maybe ? mine were on travel soccer teams oh wow we used to have to go all over the place like down river and up out towards and in milford oh okay yeah we have actually a huge soccer field right where i live in canton yeah they have uh it s called freedom park or something is that where they have the baseball too ? no it s soccer it s not off of is it ? no it s it s it s a different one ? yeah yeah maybe you ll get to just uh stay in canton
okay with you ? mm hmm
okay you re taking your calcium with vitamin d supplements and all that and an aspirin ? yes yeah yes okay almost forgot the aspirin now you know you haven t had a colonoscopy right ? oh yeah and so i m going to order that you know you did i got the sheet but they have um they haven t called you yet ? yeah they said they would call me for an appointment and they haven t called me back okay so if they don t you know let me know because i don t know what the wait time is like with them uh but they should its right by my phone because i know i ll put it off if i don t keep it right there okay you know this is an open access colonoscopy that they re doing and um so uh we re supposed to just fax it to a center place and they re supposed to call you mm hmm so they should uh now the tetanus shot did you get the tetanus shot when you were hurt ? okay so should i say it is ? oh you know i don t you had a lot of open areas so i would expect that or do you think they forgot ? because i have to give you a booster if they did not if you did not have one in the last years you know what i honestly don t remember okay you want me to go ahead and do it ? i think it s better we do it than not okay ? yeah i honestly during that time don t remember it right okay okay um and the mammogram you already made the appointment ? that is this afternoon i made it all for one day okay so you have all the paperwork for all of this ? you re doing your supplements and all that ? mm hmm i can t chicken out
wonderful okay and um good so you know that you re a little bit overweight though right ? yes okay so that s the next thing you know to get you to exercise and lose you know what i m hoping as my leg gets stronger i can take more you know i mean i m doing that eight nine hours at work but i know that that doesn t get rid of the weight because it s it s not what did they explain it to me it s not long term walking no mm hmm it doesn t get your heart rate up you know it s like for a lot of people what i do here could look like exercise because i m constantly walking between the rooms i hardly sit down it isn t for me it s not great that great enough for my heart because my heart rate doesn t go up you know it stays right your body is used to to it so you have to do and i know what your limitation you have to figure out whatever works for you i don t want you to go into pain um treadmill may not be be the best thing for you but um maybe i don t know swimming or um stationary bike i actually started walking walking the dog okay good i started doing that and you know therapy for your leg uh because it s good to strengthen the muscles okay ? because that s what you need to do for pain relief and also the um to build up the strength you know you need to strengthen the muscles and the way to strengthen the muscles is walking swimming biking and things like that oh not biking no ? not yet come on that s how i broke my leg i know that s scary right ? it s very scary do you have a fear to get on the bike or ? do you have a stationary bike ? maybe you could go on there first you know i ve been thinking about that because i have promised my granddaughter that i will get on the bike this summer and i will but yeah there is a fear mm hmm there s a fear the same as the fear when i started walking again you know it s just i ll get over it haven t yet oh i m sorry yeah try the stationary bike if you have one and then you can gradually you know transfer yourself to the mobile one the bike i actually miss bike riding yeah ? but i m i looked at the bike yesterday it was like oh not today you know how they say weird things happen only once in your lifetime ? so you re probably done from your mouth to god s ears and so you know let s um let s be positive about it and hopefully you know kids get you to do things and you know maybe your granddaughter s the one to do it but don t rush though i m okay with you re taking it slow and just doing what you can as long as you sort of you know strengthen the muscles there and gradually improve it don t overdo it yeah okay ? alright is there anything or do you have any concerns or questions before we start the exam ? mm mm no ?
okay good okay i m going to first to like the part that i don t have expose you and then you can tell me if you want her to leave the room um okay ? do you want her to when we come to the pelvic and the breast exam ? or i can pull the curtain either way you can pull the curtain if you want

right so i mean that s the life you know you work during the week days and then you catch up on the other stuff on the weekends the six loads of laundry and right the only bad thing is too that you re stuck shopping when it s so busy right right well you know my husband doesn t mind doing groceries he thankfully that part oh that s great he s okay with because he thinks that once i go in there i take longer so i ve i m like i m fine with it but i think you know in a way um that also a negative thing because then i don t even know what goes on in the stores my friends keep telling me oh we bought this we bought that like oh wow really you know it looks so cute and uh so you know you don t what s out there right right but it helps me he doesn t any other domestic stuff yeah i mean you know uh maybe twice a year he might fold the clothes so i m he sounds like my husband used to until i got hurt oh d d learned how to do a lot once i got hurt yeah ? good yeah he doesn t and to the point where you know it s one of those things that even if you don t like to you have to do it there s a whole list of those those things those things right ? and and i think women are stuck with those more than men mm hmm i shouldn t generalize though because i know where men do those too but you know we re the ones who are more like you know you have to get things done or it makes you very unhappy i think we i think it s that we ll do it and they re comfortable more so of not doing it exactly yeah because i mean i don t like to do a lot of things i don t like to wash floors and i hate windows i know it no yeah right and i got a cleaning lady though because it it was i mean do the laundry and everything else i would just i was either folding clothes or a rag in my hand cleaning so that that s better because now i sort of let things i m not as a perfectionist i let things go oh they come and clean it you know okay so oh you have to i mean you have to with your schedule right yeah or or i wouldn t have any time with the kids and i love to spend time with that s why i m not not that much into shopping and all that because i just every minute i have i play with them i love yeah i love to spend that s wonderful i m sorry i don t want to get you soiled yeah i just because i hate for them to grow get to be teenagers mm hmm you know i think my uh daughter and i both have things you know because we do a lot of things like scrap booking you know now and she can she connects really well with me oh yeah mm hmm um my son i didn t think it bothered him he s all sports you know yeah and but you know he insists that i play with him and my husband says oh that s only because he can beat you oh what if you get what if you beat him ? well i i i sort of compete with him mm hmm but um i make him feel good to and my husband does the same but i don t know it is it s something with my son that he wants me to spend time with him i i think it s just that he recognizes and although does not express you know he s a typical man i mean he doesn t express very well my daughter very clear right off the cuff ? yeah and um and um one day he said you don t do anything with me and then i there you go so he gets like jealous i think you know but he doesn t say come and play with me so he s more like for whatever reason keeps asking me to do things with him like his projects for school everything i think boys need moms more than we think they do mm hmm i want you to do it i want you to do it and i think maybe i m a little bit more you know patient and make i make him do it mm hmm and husband will be there but he s like doing his own thing and okay do it right right some men just don t seem to i know my sons but even now that they re older they come to me for different things mm hmm really ? and then of my daughter and i are both close yeah yeah so i think we ll be okay even when they re teenagers hopefully yeah but it s so much fun with them now i still enjoy being with them she s your daughter s six ? mm hmm and your son s how old ? eight she s six and a half and he s eight yeah that s that s neat
that s right you know so that s good you know you did very well okay your exam is normal uh i didn t find anything no problem
yes so what i got to do is work on the weight and the smoking
right right and um i uh will let you know you know i did want ask you lately i ve been getting like that um night sweats again like i m waking up sweating okay mm hmm when was your last period by the way ? a year ago december it s done i mean through the grace of god they re done uh huh would it is it okay if i start taking the that was before i saw you mm hmm and then um it s just been the past maybe about three weeks i m starting to go through it again and i m waking up at night well let me tell you this because these are so called herbal medications so over the counter mm hmm we cannot uh actually recommend any of those we do not know the risks of taking those they re not fda approved yeah um that s the thing but we don t recommend hormones either now that we know that they could be harmful right right the side effects of those okay um soy is one of those things they say might help with hot flashes okay ? mm hmm uh you could sort of do soy products and see if it helps uh but you know we can t say yes or no for those herbal stuff because we really don t recommend them we don t know the side effects yet right there s been no studies done on them ? then i ll try the soy and see i i think i think they re getting a little better about actually you know at least doing studies on a few that are very commonly used so hopefully in a few years we ll have more data of how safe they are we have more women doctors up in those positions right right well yeah and they ll they ll know and they ll push forward for research on that if it gets really really bad you let me know there are some medications we can prescribe uh there is a blood pressure pill called that i have used in patients that are very bad and we do not want them to take hormones and um they ve benefited from it some of them so if it gets so bad that will be an option but again you know you probably will be okay not doing anything except trying increasing the soy and you know uh sometimes vitamin e helps but with aspirin it can thin your blood more and bruise your skin so uh be cautious about that but you know they do say that vitamin e somehow seems to help with hot flashes sometimes but with black cohosh medically we can t say you know right but medically you can t
i mean you know i probably have a handful of women that use it no one complain anything and i think when i ordered your blood work i ordered the whole profile i ll know what your liver enzymes are and so forth so okay ? so i ll send you all your reports as they come sounds good okay ? and uh if you don t get any results like within three weeks after you do the blood test and even you know three weeks from now and your pap give me a call because you should get your reports not later than a month you should definitely get them in the next three weeks
no i just thought one more thing i have to ask you mm hmm my daughter had um two miscarriages within a year and she s going to a doctor a specialist because he s going through things but he did some blood work and he found she didn t bring me the pamphlet but it was mth thank you and he found that she has that is that something i mean it made it sound like it was hereditary yeah we could right we could check your blood for that and um did he say that you needed to be tested for it ? he just said she she would more likely when she starts getting um when she goes to get pregnant he s going to start her on the you know so but i mean with something like that it affects her pregnancy and i know it affects clotting right but i don t need to know all that for me do i ? well we do not know who she inherited from you know dad or mom so let s blame it on dad i m kidding
uh i can add that though you know i can ask them to do it i think it will be good that way at least you know yeah it can predispose to strokes i mean it s basically thicks your blood it makes your blood thick and that s where she s going and usually if they do find that you have the mutation uh in the gene they just tell you to take an aspirin i haven t seen them put patients on coumadin or blood thinners yeah is a blood thinner
well that s remember when i had to take that in at the after the hospital yeah but you also had the dvt the clot remember oh yeah yes so we uh attributed at that time to the uh to the bed ridden status and that you could not you were not mobile so uh it not a bad idea to check for this you know to go but again you know i don t think there will be a recommendation for you to be on coumadin or something big like that right i mean it all depends on risk factors it may be a good idea if uh god forbid you have to go through another surgical procedure uh we should probably make a recommendation if you re positive for the mutation that you take before the surgery and right after the surgery and but after the surgery i mean anything prolonged uh immobility you know should be careful okay ? but i think we should go ahead and order it
i just remember she just came home last night and told me about that oh poor girl but she ll be okay though you know they have good this is it s not even uncommon anymore it s like i hear it so frequently and i think it is not that we all are changing our genetics now it s just that uh we we have more testing and we re able to find out and in the past okay well she just couldn t carry the children she had miscarriages and uh sorry you know mm hmm but now that we have these genetic tests to see if there s a problem with the clotting but she was funny she lost two she had two miscarriages mm hmm and the one doctor that she saw said oh it s only two and she said and i went with her to this office and i said you know what maybe we need to talk to somebody else mm hmm he should have been a little bit more sympathetic right right yeah even one is very very difficult to deal with yeah that oh i ve never had to deal with it through the grace of god but i know people have i know oh you know i dealt that with my sister my sister in law it s very difficult mm hmm it s uh one one is enough i m telling you my sister had like nine of them and they finally found out it was progesterone she went though fertility doctors went through losses and then finally with her oldest daughter they gave her progesterone and she carried her oh okay and then she had two more on her own so oh good yeah that s painful i know it is so uh well hopefully he s um who does she see ? i can t remember the gentleman s name the doctor s name uh which uh system which health system ? it s henry ford oh it is henry ford ? it s henry ford yeah she s under um she s come to see you for the quit smoking and that then she went out there she said she had to make an appointment with you for something but she has a whole list of stuff going on what s the name d c she goes to the she goes downstairs to um the midwife right right and then she goes out to um at west bloomfield ? mm hmm mm hmm and goes out there and he did a battery of tests on her but i know she s planning on coming in to see me about something else okay okay okay okay well um i ll see her and i think it will be fine but they have some good specialists you know who can guide her in the right direction i know they like take blood it was good to see you
good to see you again and um except for the little bit of weight loss we ve talked about you know um for your height you should probably not be over a hundred twenty pounds she put five two does it seem realistic to you ? five two yeah i well i know i m overweight yeah so that means pounds it seems like a lot but go slow um you know just if you cut down by calories a day that s almost like two and a half pounds a month most of it too is the night eating mm hmm i was doing that when i was sick yeah cut down the starches a little bit and you know so gradual little steps at a time there s always like pounds for women that s difficult to lose but if you can lose at least pounds that ll be great okay ? okie doke
alright ? take care dear and get dressed and wait here i ll get you the paperwork okay ? okay thank you you re welcome so i ll see you maybe in a year
excuse me oh hi hi i'm from research oh okay oh i'm sorry i didn't know you were i'm sorry i'll just get out of your way here no no i'm sorry i forgot i know i had an e i forgot that it was today right thank you okay have you met mr k ? yes i have okay i haven't actually met the patient hi mr k how are you ?
how are you ? i'm good i'm dr a nice to meet you now are you ready to start
i have a little recorder here that's
okay so so how have you been doing ? i've been doing pretty good last three or four days i've been getting a little dizziness okay and did it seem like it started fairly suddenly the dizziness ? i had it before maybe about six seven months ago but it went away so i guess it's coming back okay and was it is it like you feel the room spinning around you or is it more of a lightheadedness ? okay and do you feel like you're going to pass out ? no not pass out okay or have you passed out at all ? okay does it seem like it comes on if you change positions ? like if you stand up or turn to the side ? well sometimes when i'm sitting down get up it happens most of the time it's basically there okay so has it been there all the time or it comes and goes ? it comes and goes i used to for it it would go away for a couple hours then it would come back okay i'm sorry you were taking what ? anacin pain pills oh okay and now the dizziness do you have any other symptoms with it ? like do you get chest pain or headaches do you feel your heart racing ? okay have you been eating pretty well lately ? pretty well yeah okay and how about drinking have you been drinking a lot of water ? that i haven't been doing okay any other problems besides the dizziness ?
i had some medication for and i'm still using the restroom like two three times a night okay and that's the flomax that you've been taking ?
right and i also had a water pill which i need some more of i can't find the prescription or the name of it oh the yeah that's what it was taking along with the blood pressure pill okay so have you run out of the water pill ? okay how long have you been out of it ? i've been out a good while at least a couple months okay how about the other blood pressure pill the ? are you out of that ? i'm due for almost for a refill just about ten left in them then get a refill okay and the ? i need some of those you ran out of those too ? okay and have you been out of them about the same amount of time as your other water pill ? about the same okay okay 'cause your blood pressure is is high today but if you've run out o f the water pill and the those both help with blood pressure also so that may be why the pressure's running high it normally was high anyway
even when you're taking the medicines ? okay and then with the dizziness now it could be too if the pressure's running on the high side sometimes that can cause dizziness but there are some other things too that can cause it so we'll probably end up checking some blood work to see how to make sure everything looks okay with your hemoglobin your blood counts and your electrolytes the other thing too the blood work may help with this but if you are a little dehydrated that sometimes can cause some dizziness so if you haven't been drinking very much water that will be important too to try increase the amount of water that you're drinking now i saw before you're taking this medicine was that for the dizziness ? do you remember ? i don't remember
okay and then the flomax for the prostate the has that helped at all ? i know you're still going to the bathroom two or three times i'm still going two or three times a night okay was it worse than that before you started the medicine ? well before i started it it was about the same but it helped for about a couple weeks after that it stopped helping okay because what we can do with that is we can actually increase the strength of that to two pills at night does the urine come out pretty strong is it a good flow a good stream ? no it's not okay any blood in the urine ? okay do you urinate a lot during the day ? mainly at night well about he same day and night okay yeah a lot of times people notice it more at night because during the day if you're going you don't notice it quite as much as when you have to wake up and how about any burning when you go to the bathroom ?
okay any fevers or chills ? any other problems you've been noticing ? i can't think of any offhand okay how about any problems with any shortness of breath ? okay any abdominal pain ? any nausea or vomiting ? any constipation or diarrhea ? any blood in the bowel movements ? and now are you allergic to anything ? and besides the are you taking any other medications ? okay the protonix do you still take that for haven't took that in a while okay have you had problems lately with acid reflux ? okay and then the do you still take that ? okay any over the counter medications ?
okay and now do you smoke ? i still smoke about a pack a day okay now have you smoked more than that in the past ? no about that's about always been about that okay and how long have you been smoking ? twenty years okay now have you thought about quitting lately ? yeah i thought about it haven't got to it yet okay now is it are you feeling ready to quit ? yeah i'm ready to quit but i haven't quit okay now did you want to did you want to try anything ? like any medication to help with the smoking ? i could do that yeah have you tried anything in the past ? okay because there's a couple options there are things like the nicotine replacement which basically is like the nicotine patches nicotine gum or lozenges which basically is substituting the nicotine for the cigarettes so that you don't start don't stop the nicotine suddenly and start getting kind of withdrawal symptoms so those are one one means of treatment the others are some of the medicines that decrease the cravings for the cigarettes and those are things like the pills the can cause sometimes side effects where people have these vivid dreams so that's the main side effect to kind of watch out for you can get a little bit of nausea but it kind of depends on what method you prefer because if you do use the patches and smoke on top of it you'll be getting kind of double the dose of nicotine which can cause problems so i would prefer the patch
you would okay okay and do you drink alcohol at all ? okay any drugs other than medications ? and are there any medical problems in your family ? my mother had high blood sugar hearing problem any other medical problems ?
any cancers that run in the family ? and it's been a little while since you've been here so you're also due for some tests some blood work now have you eaten today ? earlier that was almost this morning okay about what time would you say ? maybe eight o'clock okay so we can actually it's probably been long enough that we can check the blood work today that won't be any problem so you didn't eat any lunch or any snack after that okay so we'll check the blood work the other thing you're due for too is colon cancer screening now have you ever had a colonoscopy ?
okay are you familiar with the test ? vaguely yeah okay so what it is is a test where they after age it's recommended for everyone to get colon cancer screening they have you drink some solution to help clean out your intestine then they take a very small camera and they go up your bottom inside your rectum and take a look at your colon your large intestine looking for any growths or polyps anything that is cancerous or could turn into cancer and it's kind of a screening test looking for any you know to try to pick up any thing that could turn into cancer any cancers early again for anyone over age it is recommended so since you haven't had one i think it would be a good idea did you want me to get you setup to yeah mm hmm have one of those ? the other test too is the prostate cancer screening so for men over age there's kind of different screening tests for prostate cancer and it kind of depends on it's not like the colonoscopy where there are guidelines for it but there's the blood test where we check your psa level and if that's high then sometimes in prostate cancer that blood test can be high but there are other things that can cause it to be high too if you have any enlarged prostate like you have or if you have inflammation of the prostate that can make it high so usually what we do is we check that and if it's high then we have you see the urologist the ones who specialize in the prostate the other test is the digital rectal exam which is i don't know if you've had have you had one of those before where they put their finger inside your bottom to feel the prostate oh i had that you've had that one before ? mm hmm okay so because we could check both of those today too while you're here okay be all right what's that ? that'd be all right that'd be all right ? okay and then the last thing is the tetanus shot now that's a shot that you get to help protect you if you happen to cut yourself with rusty metal or a rusty nail to prevent lockjaw an infection that can cause lockjaw so it's recommended every ten years do you know when your last tetanus shot was ? i had one about six months ago nine months ago oh okay okay great so you're fine with that did you injure yourself or was it just a routine no just a routine
okay okay all right and then do you you pretty much need refills on the rest of the medications ? okay and did they take your pharmacy information out front when you checked in ? okay which pharmacy do you usually use ? okay which one ? i'm sorry which cvs which location ? cbs cbs oh cbs ? okay where is that located ?
okay okay and what i'm going to do is have you take a seat here because i did want to recheck your blood pressure it's over so pretty similar do you mind if i pull the curtain sure no go ahead you can go ahead want me to step out ? i was just going to do the exam so okay yeah pull you can pull the curtain thank you
okay i'm just going to get you adjusted can you open your mouth for me can you say ah ? now have you had any changes in your weight weight loss weight gain or have you been kind of steady with it ? i've been pretty steady okay how about any swelling in the hands the feet ? can you swallow ? do you feel this swelling in your back yeah i guess i it was swollen you haven't noticed any difference
i'm going to have you lie back i had this one here ? it doesn't hurt okay so it's been stable almost the same so it never bulged it always goes back down it doesn't stay out don't stay out only time it comes out sure okay but then once you're up it goes back down goes down
all right so what i was going to do is actually we can go ahead and check your blood work today i'll refill your prescriptions for the blood pressure medications and water pill and that flomax what we'll do is increase that from one pill to two pills to see if that helps with some of the urine flow so the flomax that i have might just continue taking it but add another pill to it yeah or you can continue what you have but instead of taking one pill take two pills every time we'll check the blood work and also what i'll do is get you set up to have the that colonoscopy test too what i'm hoping is once you're kind of back on your blood pressure medicines that and the blood pressure looks better that and that may help with some of the dizziness also if you drink more water that may help with some of the dizziness too i'll probably have you come back let's say about one or two months something like that just to make sure the pressure's come down once you've been back on all the medicines and i'll go ahead and send through the prescription for the nicotine patches and the what probably the best way to do is kind of set a quit date so maybe just say april st will the day you stop smoking so on that day first thing in the morning you put on the patch and it starts out as a high dose of milligram and you put that on in the morning then you take it off and put a new one on the next day and like i said it has nicotine so if you smoke on top of it you'll be getting extra nicotine so just be be cautious of that so you usually use the milligram patch for six weeks and then you drop down to a milligram patch for three weeks and then a seven milligram patch for three weeks so it's kind of tapering the nicotine slowly so you don't have withdrawal symptoms and to from the nicotine okay ? now do you have any questions ? no no questions okay all right well it will take me a few minutes to get the paperwork together but if you want to start getting dressed you can and you can wait right in here for the medical assistant to discharge you okay ?
how are you ? sorry you re in here waiting it s cold mm hmm right ? sorry about that do you want to sit up for a minute here ? how do you feel ? alright so you re in for a physical is that right ? did dr w recommend it ? or is it your idea ? no someone called me and said i was due for a physical okay well you certainly are due for some updates um do you need some prescription renewals from me today ?
um she said cozaar the nurse said the cozaar sure and that s going to go here do you need to pick that up today or just in the future ? okay alright well she she also marked a bunch of other ones the toprol yeah she just mark those checking them against what i have so you don t need any others then ? i don t think so i mean i think i have one that s um the there s isordil is that it ? and i noticed dr s dr w can also do it but i m i m happy to do it this one here it doesn t have refills on it right right so i can do that for you okay is there anything else that we specifically no ? uh uh well let me just make sure i understand i know your you know it s a long list of them but yes it is twenty five yeah twenty five ? and then i think dr w made your zocor one and a half the milligrams that s what note says told me to take three of them oh the the zocor ? yeah they were um and then she told me to take three of them oh so so that added up to make it right because then she it looks like she called in milligrams to take one and a half maybe when you run out mm hmm and are you still on wellbutrin ? you re not on right ?
okay and then how much insulin are you taking now ? let me see which one is which okay this one is a day and when do you take that morning or evening ? okay and then the ? and this one is three times after each meal before each meal thank you and how much is that ? how much do you take ? um it was like ten ten and twelve mm hmm and then i upped it to and okay and when did you do that ? um about a month and a half ago and then by memory or looking ? no i mean they they have they ve been high when did you last check it ? this morning what d you get ? it was i think that s not bad well it is for me and then what about in the last week ? have you had any other ones in the morning or before meals ? it s always after ? when um when i take it after they re always really high you mean two hours after mealtime ? what numbers do you get ? they re always high they re like or um sometimes they re like what are they before meals ? do you ? before meals before meals they re like um you know and then they just shoot up okay so in general um if you re uh even if it s after a meal then if you ve checked it before the next meal does it still come down to ? mm hmm so it s generally sometimes it ll come sometimes you know if it s it ll come down to like so two twenty before the meal ? or okay so you don t have a written record with you ? not with me do you make one ? so i guess what i m trying to get at is if it s or after a meal does it stay high before the next meal then ? yeah like i m saying if it s like after a meal and then when i check it again before a meal it ll be like okay um and how often is that does that happen ? is that typical ? so that means you re not controlled well so just you know i m happy to do a physical today and i want to work with you but you know if you don t come in every three months it s hard to work on the sugars do do you understand that ? mm hmm okay you know either go ahead i don t know i thought they were said they were going to send me a a thing um for a reminder to make an appointment that s a good question i have doctors so i know i know you see a lot of doctors so i saw you in december and um it s been that long ? yeah it s been a really long time i wondered why i hadn t seen you again i knew when i last saw you i said start checking the sugars because i know it was and i wanted to see you back three three months and i think they said they didn t have the schedule or something they would send me a reminder and they didn t okay you know what and you i what you re saying may well be completely true so what i d like you to do is just forget what they say and you just need to come back really every three months and sometimes we might do it sooner or we might get a specialist involved did you ever see a a for your diabetes ? you never did ? i don t think so yeah because i mean we need to get your sugar controlled well you know you re about to embark on a transplant and things like that and if i can t control it well with you then we need help so i just want to be open about that and that we need to do better um you know just regarding the sugar in december it was bad mm hmm it it had been like you know about in the previous march so it can be but i think in december you weren t really taking your insulin how often in a week are you it now ? um maybe when i skip a meal okay so i mean i mean only and i may skip a meal every day right but eating a meal with no insulin how often do you forget to take insulin before a meal ? um sometimes i i try to remember to take it when i m at work but usually it s like minutes and then that s the only time i have and i try to remember to take it in that time but it s hard do you do you have your pen with you ? mm hmm at at work ? mm hmm do you and and i leave myself a note mm hmm so you re still forgetting ? forgetting so that s a real problem how about morning and evening ? take it i usually remember to take it the evenings i remember but mornings if i m rushing i don t take it because you know the only way we re going to control of the sugar is to take i mean i i think you could be under good control if you just took the insulin and like what i don t know then is those sugars when your sugar s and after a meal have you actually taken the insulin those times ? mm hmm you have ? but then maybe it started high because you didn t insulin the meal before or well that could be see that s the or i didn t take it yeah didn t take it the meal before maybe or maybe you are taking it and then we re not giving you enough that s what i don t know so that s why i see what you re saying can you get even though you check it on your are you making a little booklet with it ? do you have one ? mm hmm you know and then if you can write down how much insulin you took i know that s some work but then it gives us a way to track it did you take insulin the time before ? you know even if you don t check your sugar the time before did you take the insulin ? alright we need some pre and post meal readings right ? so i really don t i don t what i know i know i i forget to take because it s so much it is a lot but we all you know all my meds right let me get to the physical because the diabetes is a real important issue but oh do you have is that your sugar ? this is just the it s the oh your monitor ?
no i m having one wednesday oh you are having one ? oh okay did they give you the prep and everything ? i m going to get it today the prep ? are they going to mail it to you or what ? no they told me to um pick it up at the pharmacy who s where are you having it done ? the hospital you know you you can check with them now what what what i ve been told is that they re all using this prep but if you if they have prescribed you something then do that whatever they say to do this is over the counter but i need you to check and see what they want you to do okay this is because i need to i don t know this may be the same thing though okay that s different if they want you to have that that s okay did they tell you what to do with your insulin ?
um i don t know everything is here they they know you re diabetic right ? i don t know say much about your insulin i don t even think they addressed it oh do not take your am dose so take your lantis the night before and what you can do is since you ll be drinking some juices during the day mm hmm you should check your sugar and then you might need you might need a small dose of of i m sorry yeah this yeah what they re saying here is okay and i ll tell you okay so this is what they want um okay they say no aspirin don t they ? no they didn t say no aspirin good alright tell me when you re ready to hear this okay ? okay um um the day before you re supposed to drink just clear liquids right ? so you d take your lantis you know actually tonight right ? because tomorrow s your prep day mm hmm and then you would be drinking clear liquids so you re insulin your novolog dosing would be a lot less might be less check your sugars frequently i would still check them like you know four times a day but since you re not really eating and you re just maybe drinking some apple juice right ? clear liquids mm hmm maybe some jello things like that see what your sugars are and you might take a modified dose of novolog you know how much should you take ? i guess it depends how much juice you drink but you know i you you know novolog s going to be gone in two to three hours from your system so you you could always check your sugar again in three hours and say oh you know what ? i only took six units mm hmm um or or eight units and gee maybe i need more than that i mean you can always dose yourself again kind of watch it carefully and then um well they say don t so and what is your is your colonoscopy first thing in the morning ? so i would still take i would take the lantis at night were you planning to take the lantis tuesday night ? yeah i would they said don t take anything after midnight so yeah i was going to take it so i would take that in the evening yeah and then in the morning when you go just tell them you know you do have some insulin on board and they may want to give you you know in the iv they may want to give you a little bit of sugar or whatever they want to do and then they they need to check your sugars okay ? alright so you re going to have the colonoscopy do you recall if you ve had a tetanus shot in the last ten years ?
last ten years ? you haven t had or you don t recall ? i i had one it s been exactly ten years is that right ? you remember that ? mm hmm yes because my grandson was four and he s now wow if you remember that that s great then you would need one today you know i thought that i saw something let me look here now is it every i thought is it every ten years or even seven years ? it s every ten years so if you think it s been ten years yep i know then you know because it was his birthday that s pretty good that you remember that so that s the only thing i remember do you remember where you got it ? i just remember that i got it okay so what we ll do today then is we will give you um a diphtheria tetanus shot okay ? mm hmm so your arm may be a little bit sore and then you are due as you know for a mammogram right ? mm hmm so you re going to get that done ? mm hmm and then you need your pap smear okay ? mm hmm
and your last blood work showed problems with sugar and liver tests and all sorts of stuff and then dr w i think gave you a slip to get a lipid profile a cholesterol profile in six to eight weeks did she ? yeah i have to do it this week you re going to do that ? okay and i yeah she she gave you a paper right ? mm hmm okay and i ll tell you what when you get that where what lab are you going to get that in ? i think i have it with me so i was going to do it here just can i do i can do it here can t i ? yeah you have a slip though right ?
if you re going to do it here then i want to add a glycated hemoglobin to that which just averages tells us the average sugar now if i order it here they ll just put it in the computer but then you need to tell them that besides the slip that you re showing them there s also something in the computer for you or they won t do it do you mind reminding them ? uh uh okay so that will be done like later in the week you know when you do the other ones you re not doing it today right ? are you fasting now ? okay so whenever you do her slip you ll do this okay ? let me just look at something else wait a minute you ve also had what s wrong with my liver ? it s just whenever you re in congestive failure it looks like your liver tests become abnormal dr w found that to be true so dr w you know went over that okay alright so glycated hemoglobin later in the week okay and then um are you having trouble with shortness of breath currently ? um no like did you walk sorry ? now did you walk down the long hall yourself today ? mm hmm did you have to stop and rest ? i should have but i didn t so you got a little winded ? okay any bowel movement problems ? any what ? trouble with your bowels ? uh uh sorry ? no ? okay and then who are you living with now please ? my my daughter okay and you don t have to share this with me are you sexually active ? do we need to worry about checking for venereal disease ? and you re done not having periods right ? and then um any alcohol use ? um i drink you know beer wine no alcohol beer and wine are alcohol too how much do you drink ? i mean right but any any of that counts so how much in a day will you have of wine or beer ? uh oh well it s not like i drink it often so so more than one cup in a day of wine ? maybe yeah maybe two glasses of wine when i do have it which is infrequent right ? mm hmm very infrequent not not weekly even ? and then how about beer ? how many will you have ? hmm same thing uh two beers ? so just so you know even though you re not doing it every day we recommend for a woman no more than one drink in a day like one glass of wine or one beer

okay um tetanus shot eight years ago we gave you one i think you just gave me one last year i think we did now what about any other you want a flu shot ? i was going to ask you about that i think that kind of changes things so you might have an advantage if you took it yeah okay then i ll grab one yeah let s do that it s not a live virus any more is it ? it s not let s see no i just want to make sure you know i don t want to take any chances on getting the flu from the shot you can t get the flu from the shot i heard people say that they got sick on it they say they get sick from it but it s not the flu they might feel edge um fatigue or achy ness that s about it it s only the outer shell of the virus it s not the real virus oh okay no yeah let s go for it sure and i think it s also from people who had it coming and it was on it s way and it got them yeah well also too the uh with uh the it does lower your immune a little bit so yeah that s why i m thinking about that right i ve never had it before and i get the flu so let s try it and see what happens okay yeah let s do that and you did have a you had that flu shot the um tetanus okay how s your cat ?
the cat is great the cat is great somebody was telling me oh god it was a horror it was a cat horror story she needed to get her cat s teeth professionally cleaned and so she did and they somehow i guess they had to the cat well they do yeah yeah and they punctured the trachea and had to put the cat on respirator and uh ha poor little thing before she know it it was thousands of dollars for this cat
our our cat is uh it goes on the boat with us you know it s spoiled that s really cool but you have you go with who ? who s favorite crew members ?

yeah that s good so do you ever get any chest pains ? shortness of breath ? take some deep breaths out good in and out that sounds good don t get dizzy any pain here ? any back problems ?

that's great ready ? ready set go in that room on the left with the lights on and you can either sit up here if you'd like to or sit down there take your pick put this up for you so you can sit here i can sit down here e you want to sit ? oh no i'm okay okay let's see it's that time of year for you actually it's oh my god it's probably that can't be that can't be right probably a little past that time of year a little past that time of year ? little bit that sounds euphemistic that must be wrong it's gotta be wrong no it's probably right i had well that's probably the last actual physical ? complete physical now i had been having my i brought it with me i had been having my although my filing system is poor i had been getting my blood my cholesterol and stuff checked with health department thing so i haven't been oh god forbid that takes care of all you preventative health care needs i haven't been totally as bad as it sounds i know but i was in here i just didn't get the complete thing
wow well let's go back through some encounters and then the last time i saw you i was just sick as a dog and yeah i remember that that respiratory illness i know i just that was the worst thing i ever had in my whole entire life and i don't ever ever ever want it again you've had a scope put down from above mm hmm biopsy the esophagus no findings there well they did that esophageal web removal you know so he just went back to check that out and i still don't swallow quite like a normal person but it's way better since he got that web out of there my blood pressure is still a little bit weird it tends to go up and down depending on whatever i'm not sure what it depends on at home it's always good at home it's always good ? i don't maybe not my pressure machine is where else do you check it at ? i check it at the ymca in a nurse's office occasionally just to and i check it when i go to the health department for my other thing ymca it's fun to be at the i'm really really hoping that this weight loss is going to keep the blood pressure and cholesterol where it's supposed to be but we'll see okay so and we've had a history of some high cholesterol dating back a lot of years and some childhood asthma some hay fever some kidney difficulty around the time of your first pregnancy some right sided carpal tunnel syndrome some nasal polyps they sent me to an ear nose and throat specialist after two and he said those were not a problem he said it was kind of a deviated septum deviated septum i probably got my nose broken or something and some white hypertension okay you've had no cardiac problems in the interim you've had no kidney stones in the interim had no gall stones mm mm any particular joint swelling or inflammation ? no ?
except for that fit i went through last year i've never been sick from anything that was just that was just a bad bout but i still don't know what caused that i don't think dr m ever just completely figured it out it was just a weird thing have you had any surgeries the past few years ? i had foot surgery what did you have done ? it was kind of like a bunion but it was caused by he said dr c did it on both feet it was kind of bunion type surgery it was more caused by he took the shortened the big toe and put all pins in there but he said it was because the cartilage in the big toes were i do that mile walk for breast cancer every year and it was walking had gotten to be just a little bit difficult so he did that and they've been great since whatever he did was beautiful okay i think he called it a so he removed some of the end of the bone and i've had no problem doing the mile walk for breast cancer i've done that for four years and i do the half marathon and i had no problem doing that i don't do the run i do the walk you're a walking machine so my breath is good i think you know i didn't have any lingering effects from weren't winded after that bout yeah i don't have i mean i get i'm so you get out of breath a little bit i guess but
what medications are you taking right now ? i'm not taking anything beautiful nothing over the counter ? oh i take any herbal preparations ? yeah i take fish oil you take fish oil and a multivitamin how much fish oil do you take ? one teaspoon a day one teaspoon so you take a liquid preparation i do because how much is in one teaspoon ? fourteen ? does that sound right ? i should have brought it with me it's the equivalent of the pill but it just is in a liquid form and you take a multivitamin you say each day ? mm hmm okay and that's it i started doing that when i started going to weight watchers because they really really recommended it so i figured if i was going to go there i better do what they were recommending so i never had taken one before
okay not taking any prilosec or nexium or anything like that ? well good let's cleanup all these medicines on here i just took those during that fit i went through and when it was over i quit taking everything
aren't you dying to find out what that is ? what what is ? i'm always afraid to ask it's probably nothing i want to know what it is that was a gift that somebody brought me back from mexico last week really ? is it one of those puzzle things ? well it's supposed to be a jewelry box and you have to figure out how to get it open ? well yeah it wasn't it wasn't easy to open okay now now i gotta know but it was you know that's what i said oh that's hilarious
i said oh my god is that like ? oh i've got a couple of great grandkids who would love that isn't it a nice little toy ? that's hilarious all right we're not allergic to any medications alcohol intake is still rare ? yeah i'm not much of a drinker i don't particularly like the taste of it and it doesn't make me feel very good so i just don't bother
now your sister has she had any other health problems ? no she has i'm not sure her health is well i'm saying she's good s he still has to take dilantin is it dilantin ? yeah she still has to take that to avoid any seizures but but nothing other than her seizure disorder that she's had ? but she doesn't she's no she's doing great okay all right well
my daughter just had a diagnosis of cancer and that's been a really really stressful time for me this last little bit your daughter did ? yes it's just about to break my heart oh i'm sorry yeah thank you what kind of cancer ? it's anaplastic large cell lymphoma which is apparently pretty rare and extremely rare to strike women it doesn't it's in her breast so she had the breast tissue removed from but it's not so she's going through chemo right now so it's never fun to see your kids when you'd just do it for them if you could and it was in her breast it was very weird she had a swelling in her breast and then they kept having drainage and she had had implants years ago and they were kind of attributing it to that so they went in and did surgery no problem with the implants no leakage no nothing she said get them out of there you know so they took both implants out assuming that that was the problem the fluid kept building up the drainage kept so they put a drainage tube in and she had this little tupperware container for a while that she carried and they kept checking that checking that and then they started doing more tests and they did and they ended up sending the biopsy to mayo clinic u of m and karmanos before they finally were having trouble reading the pathology the histology hey were having trouble because it was just real unusual tumor but they weren't looking for that they were looking for either breast cancer or regular they were looking for something that it wasn't so it took them a while to but once they did put her it's a real aggressive form of cancer so they treat it with a real aggressive form of chemo so she's on the real heavy duty well the good news is that you know the more aggressive the tumor the more aggressive it the better the response generally and she's a she's a fighter you know my husband said the worst possible thing is that it happened to kim and the best possible thing is that nobody will fight it harder than she will so she's going to be good oh i'm sorry to hear that thank you i mean i couldn't put my feet on the floor in the morning and get through the day if i didn't believe she was going to be all right so i'm going with that she's going to be all right it's going to be a long summer that's a nasty treatment but they have better better treatment and better treatment for the side effects yes it is better than it used to be you're right she'll be she'll be good
you had a tetanus shot in yourself j and you had a pneumonia vaccination in what i haven't had and what my daughter keeps bugging me to ask you about is do you think i need a shingle shot shingles shot yeah we're we're just getting to that have you had the chicken pox before ? you know i probably did nothing i ever had as a child was ever diagnosed because i think i've told you my grandmother was a not she didn't believe in medical doctors so the first time i went to a doctor was when i had to get a blood test when i got married well what we can do is check to see if you have the antibody okay so everything was diagnosed by her we'll see if you have the antibody and then if you do that means you have had the chicken pox virus i expect i have had in that case you would be a candidate for the vaccine if you haven't had it then you would not be a candidate for the vaccine okay i know i did you get a flu shot this past year too ? yes i did okay and i have your last mammogram listed as july of that sounds about right i'm just about due you're just about due ? i thought actually no it's been i'm caught up on that no last one i have did you have one done someplace else ? yeah i have july of which would make you going on two years well that doesn't seem right i think i thought it was not even quite ready quite due yet yeah well you unless you like i say unless you had one someplace else o i haven't had one any place else that's what's on there and dr d wrote me a prescription to get a bone scan done and i lost the prescription a bone density ? yeah so i never got them done okay your last one was in so you're overdue for that okay we'll take care of all that and i thought i was caught up on my pap smear i thought i was caught up on all of that and the colonoscopy they did that when dr c saw you or no ? no i actually have you had that done ? no i had the sigmoidosocpy done but i never had the colonoscopy done you had a flexible sigmoid in march of didn't you he didn't talk to you about having having that performed ? mm mm well you've got some work to do here none of it's very difficult so that's good news are you having any trouble with your bowels right now ?
diarrhea or constipation ? blood in your stool black tarry stool ? okay do you still have do you have anything get hung up on you when you swallow now ? it's right here same place 's up higher ? okay it's where that where that he took that web out that was a really weird thing he was he was stunned that i could swallow at all it went almost all the way across my esophagus and he did remove it but i think maybe it's just i don't ever get choked anymore like i did before but i do occasionally get i just don't feel comfortable swallowing pills or anything yet i don't think i ever will do you have any difficulty urinating ? ever lose control of your urine ? when you cough or sneeze ? no ? okay have you experienced any chess pain or palpitations when you exercise ? do you get winded when you walk up a flight of stairs ? well if i walk we do stairs i do a boot camp thing at the ymca once i do enough of them i do get winded but most everybody else is too i don't think i get more winded than the normal i mean my breath is probably not as good as it used to be so i would say maybe a little bit do you have a chronic cough now ? have you had any bleeding problems ? nose bleeds gums bleeding ? no nothing like that i had one of those here's the only two i could find i don't know how reliable those are but those are the only two i could find and i had one of those life screening things done i don't know whether you need to look at that or not it was okay i think it was sort of okay so your cholesterol was improved some my ratio's good and i don't know if you want that was i don't a friend of mine was going and she talked me into going with her so i went and had that done mm hmm and i think it was probably okay and i wrote my blood pressure down for the last few days so you could just kind of see what it does it will sometimes it will go up then it will be back down to okay and i don't know what's going on with it
okay well let's just leave all this out here so i can take a look as we go through and let's get a gown for you there must be something about putting these on inside out more often than not i come in and ties in the back all right and then here's a sheet to put over the top and i'll be back in with you okay ? okay do you want just just underwear still on bra still or
did you have a pelvic exam done recently with dr d ? i thought i was caught up on d and the mammogram i really did i'm not sure when he told you to come back usually we're doing paps at your age every every one to three years i get it done every and then actually we usually stop around age i get it done every year i think i'm caught up on paps so they may they may stop doing that i think i'm good on the pap smear why don't you do me a favor and just from the you can leave your underpants on the rest i'd like off okay and then the okay okay ? sound good thank you you're welcome
is anybody home ? somebody's home couldn't find a way out so
all right let's check this pressure although it won't make a big difference to us since it goes up in here and we know what it's like at home and how is mr i ?
he's very stressed out i keep trying to get him to come see you i really think he needs help getting through this he's very stressed out over which is very good for you in here
right ?
you told me if i lost pounds this would all get better look at that i mean what was my weight last time i came in here do you have that ? that's great i think it's well i have your weight here from it was then and that was low that was back in i got fat after that so that's quite a while ago
yeah i can live with that blood pressure in this office absolutely absolutely sounds like everything is just some help with it's just so stressful at work right now
well everywhere i mean it's work and obviously with the family important and may be stressful i seem to be a little bit better about worrying things when they actually do happen he worries about things that might happen you know which you do i mean i can't i know you just do but he just he can't can't stop it can't help yourself especially if you're kind of a planner you know tend to look ahead instead of always living in the moment so you're going to tend to do put your tongue out for me and he's just in that kind of he's you know and trained to work in the automotive industry i mean i know it's it is stressful when you think about you know what if what if you know he just keeps saying how am i going to get how are we going to get through this ? i say well we will we'll you know well we all are going to have to make changes i don't think there's any question about that but i worry about him i think he i think he is more stressed out than he needs to be write up my notes is he exercising with you ? he exercise he did join the gym at work and he does work out you know three or four days a week during his lunch hour that's great the more you can do that the more it will help him i think that's i think that's helping smile for me please okay and he's always been affected by the blue and gray days of winter anyway under good conditions more than yeah he's had some seasonal problems ? he does but other than that he's good he's great
you don't have any lymph node enlargement in the neck that's good your thyroid gland feels normal you have good pulsations on both sides stop breathing stop ? stop and breathe and stop and breath no noises on either side to suggest any significant obstruction so that's good and i'm going to ask you to take some nice deep breaths and open your mouth your lungs sound great lie back for me please sit up a little bit so your weight loss was intentional
weight watchers mm hmm i've always exercised a lot so i knew exercise wasn't the because i go to the ymca every day so your big problem was eating ? i think my big problem was eating the wrong things i'm not a big eater i just needed to concentrate more on being a little bit more aware of what i was eating heart sounds great take a deep breath in for me and out and out i wanted to lose weight primarily because if i can i want to stay off medication if i can't then i can't but if i i wanted to give it my best effort to get the cholesterol in check and the blood pressure
move this arm up underneath your head a little i think you definitely have succeeded with the blood pressure and hopefully the cholesterol will pay attention too i think hopefully too my good cholesterol is usually pretty good mm hmm and we'll really be stepping up the walking now because our walks are getting longer 'cause get ready for that miles it's nice to look forward to something like that yeah it's a journey but it's something i believe in i think it's a good thing it is a good thing all these walks you could do a walk every week melanoma walk walk diabetes walk now i want to look into the lymphoma walk so many it's unbelievable well he teases me he says if you just start walking you could have been someplace warm by now i don't know about that that would be one heck of a long walk the way the weather's been lately although i guess it's going to get a little bit nice this weekend
it's been a long winter oh this you know what ? you took the words right out this has been the longest winter i can ever remember it really has it's been a gray and just a gray winter i don't think it's been a good winter and we didn't go away either we try to sneak out get away for a bit but just didn't think it was the right time to do it so we didn't go anywhere
i don't feel any masses in your breasts i usually try to get over to hawaii to see my family and i haven't been there this year i've got to get over there and see them but i have new great grandson that i haven't seen yet number seven that will be exciting to see that see him it's nice to have family in hawaii but it's just so far over there i don't like going up there yeah the tradeoff isn't quite equal is it ? just soon i'd be able to go to hawaii but have them close by to have them somewhere where i could see them magically well do you use one of those video recorders on your computers no they send me pictures but i don't i'm not you could see then you could do it live why don't you do that ? oh i know i should do that it's a cheap little investment for that camera to talk to them and see them live that'd be kind of fun and i need to get over to see my sister you know i don't like to have too many years go by without seeing her either they're certainly not ever planning on leaving hawaii so if i want to see them i better get over there so your sister's in hawaii too ? yeah my sister my son two grandsons three great grandchildren and my son my grandsons' wives lots of family well i mean i don't know so if gm folds up we'll go pick coffee i was just about to say that you know that might be a my sister my sister can use another coffee picker she has a coffee farm so if she could use i'd be good at picking coffee there might be something to that i help her on the farm when we i go over there she has a papaya farm and coffee farm is that where the phrase came from ? you coffee picking son of a gun must be
instead of cotton picking okay let's see this is dr s dictating a preventative health examination in the foot her medications at this time consist solely of a fish oil liquid preparation which she uses one teaspoon a day and a multiple vitamin she has no known allergies to medication socially she's married and has four children she's actively involved with the breast cancer walk she exercises regularly and has never been a smoker is your alcohol intake remain pretty rare ? very rare very rare her alcohol intake is minimal her family history is notable for her father dying of emphysema and her mother dying during childbirth she has a sister who suffered a cerebral aneurysm in the past and has a post operative seizure disorder unfortunately her daughter was recently diagnosed with a large cell anaplastic lymphoma found in the breast she is presently receiving treatment for this on review of systems her last diphtheria tetanus okay ?
i had one more question for you it's in my purse can i get a prescription for doggone it let me get it because i'll forget what it is i rarely rarely need it but it's a sleeping sleeping thing the only time i actually probably am ever going to use it is at the three day walk when i'm in the tent i can't sleep and last year i had some a couple of those left over from the hospital so i took one and it was wonderful i slept so if that's possible if not no big deal but i mean i would never take them probably except for so you used of these since january of last year ? well i haven't used them i used two of them the day of the walk and i used a couple more we were on vacation oh well who used them ? i think w probably took them well i did take them yeah i would caution him about i shouldn't say that because i did take them this can be addictive j okay ? i did take them after i got out of the hospital so i probably took a lot of them i haven't taken them since then i haven't taken them since last when was the walk last year in october mm hmm september the walk was in september so that's the last one i took you don't have troubles swallowing those ? i cut them in half they're little tiny little bitty things uh huh i don't sleep good but i don't really usually doesn't bother me but when you're in a tent at night and you can't sleep it's a whole different thing mm hmm from vacation in a hotel room and you can't sleep that's not good if i don't sleep at home i just get up and read but i never have been a very good sleeper well the other thing you can do if you get into that kind of a situation is just use some benadryl oh yeah
yeah and benadryl does come in a liquid too you know will work for you okay let me get this stuff together while you go ahead and get dressed and we'll make all your arrangements for what you need you'll get your blood drawn today can make the appointment for the bone densitometry which is done right next door i had a little bit of coffee this morning that's not a problem is it ? was it black ? no it had a little bit of sweet n' low in it well then you might want to get your blood drawn another day i mean if you want the most accurate results okay ? only had a couple swallows and then i remembered where i was coming i thought oh i shouldn't be drinking this
well tell b i said hi and i'm sorry that i know he's probably doing a lot of stress and stuff he is he's he just maybe he should come in and get some help i'll tell him to get in here and i'll keep my prayers for your daughter okay she's going to be all right i think she is too she'll be fine like you said when they're the more aggressive the tumor it is the more response it is to the chemotherapy because the cells are always replicating it was pretty interesting that the chemotherapy oncology nurse called all of us all the family could come in for a little class on chemo which was really really informative because he was so up front about everything and he told her right up front you're getting the most toxic of all of the chemos so your hair will be completely gone within days after the first treatment he told her all the stuff so she's not going to be blindsided by anything it wasn't pretty to hear and it's not what you that will be back but he told her you know he'll have treatments you know when she gets nauseous when she gets it was so reassuring having somebody just at least let you know what was in front of you what to expect what to expect and i felt comforted by i felt he really knew what he was doing and i think she's got a good doctor and she's got who's she working with ? it's dr c and she'll be fine it's breaking my heart but she'll be fine it will be one of those things she'll look back on say you know this is i know you know we fall down so we can learn to pick ourselves back up i'm good when it's anybody but my kids and then i'm not quite as strong as i hear you i know exactly what you're talking about all right go ahead and get dressed we'll be right back with you thank you so much you are welcome
hello hello hi dr s um i have k from from um wherever some research program where ever yes who was not really evaluating you she s evaluating me that s right but is alright if she s present ? yes unless we get to that pap smear part and then we ask her to leave
yes yes that s fine with me well my dear we ve certainly you ve been through a lot since we talked last yeah march th and you were i think on the way to your conference and you called me yeah i was on my way to the airport and i called and said you know what this can t wait so how are you ? i m good yeah i m okay sore um positive uh huh i m doing okay and what they re they re also feeling very positive from what i see they send me all the notes oh good um so i do follow it i don t always send you a letter when i hear from them yeah that s okay i m doing everything they say things i think are well next i m in week next week is my big week it s the last chemo and the last radiation and then i have my i have my follow my review cat scan i have my mri i see the surgeon and i see the medical oncologist mm hmm um i see the radiation oncologist every week anyway so all of that next week ? mm hmm yeah yeah to to figure out the next plan the great dr l the radiation oncologist believes strongly in having all the ducks in a row so that you can make your next move so you know what the next part of the plan is rather than having down time where you you know if you need more radiation but you ve been off radiation for days or something then you know that he doesn t like that so then he said sometimes that happens but that it s not his preference and so far so far i ve had everything but like he said i like chemo on mondays at the start of the week with the radiation carrying on he said there s no scientific data but i i like that and and there might be it later but i like that so what s he get from me on monday chemo appointment and days of radiation so i mean it s like little things that just again are all fitting into place there s very little down time yeah yeah it s true you say may may th you get march march th ? march th was yeah that s that s when it was that s yeah they called me on may th march th that there s something suspicious on the chest x ray for this to be for just to have the procedure for having this removed and um dr um g the emt guy that he sent me to he said he called me and he said this very talented radiologist thinks he sees something suspicious you need to come back here we were at the bank oh i said okay and i just knew it was going to be a shadow because he had said sometimes you see shadows on chest x rays but it wasn t and he called me the next day at school he said are you sitting down ? and i said yeah he said there will be more tests but this is serious we are pretty sure that when we look at this we think it s cancerous so you re going to start a procedure and you know then that night he called me when i had gone to my dad s after work and i was still not sure so i was after the fact you had already heard from him yeah then he called me so it was very i mean every body in this whole system nurses doctors every body beyond this system my friends my husband my colleagues my family i mean it s just been i call it my adventure but it s for want of another word you know but everybody s just been wonderful and i m that s why i m just know i m going to beat this so i m very confident because everything i hear from them is very positive we don t have any medications listed for you why is that ? because i couldn t remember the name i m on an antibiotic now because of the blip last week and i got an infection in my port and i had a fever and they put me in the er for hours and put me on a dose of antibiotics as a result and i can t remember the name of my two chemo drugs i mean i have this big binder i just didn t think to bring it and everything s in there yeah we really should be including this into the records so um i don t know whether it will be easier for you to call or to come back or or what make sure do you have hap insurance ? mm hmm
well you could email it to me do you know anything about ? mm mm um we now have electronic office visit for those people who are busy okay sure i can do that um so this is just a sales blurb on here this is how you re going to log in it takes five to seven days to get your password in an emergency you could do it this way if you want and then you eventually access it and see that i ve sent you something ? oh i access it every day i look every day to see what people have revisited me i think twice a day i do it at noon before i leave and um i get okay yeah in fact i can do that so that s an option too or you can write it down and drop it off here you could mail it to me you could call me however you want we do need to know what how and um and the dosage how you re taking it and i ve got all of that because they give you everything i mean i know my blood work i every time every monday when they draw my blood and they bring back the sheet and
i m going to your chart the computer is saying that it s time for a pap smear is that the case ? that s probably the only place i haven t been looked poked or prodded in recent months mm hmm and you need stool cards too and then um have you had a colonoscopy ? time to think about that i mean not this very moment but i can give you a little information and they can go over it you want to okay it ll it ll be a while before i m ready to do you want do you think a year ? wait a year and i ll bring it up at again at your next physical ? i d rather alright i ll do that
i ll do that okay let s see i can get the e.r physician s report all through this times daily yeah they gave it to me intravenously first to make sure i wouldn t have a reaction because of the penicillin and i tolerated it and so then they gave it to me as the over the counter well not over the counter but mm hmm and dr t note from um plans to continue with weekly she ll see me back in or weeks so he s agreeable to three mm hmm try either so you ve had some constipation problems ? horrible constipation but that s resolved oh it has ? um actually that worked out was a combination of um prunes and increased uh apples and oranges very good i like the natural way better mm hmm oh do you ? i don t like them that much i have each morning and um i have a couples cups of fruit not not whole cups but a couple servings of fruit a day so your changes are doing good and that s mm hmm and purposes when ? that s um one of the things that s happening next week on the th then some right monday nights when i have chemo it s very hard to sleep because of the one drug that s got an upper or something in it and so i take one milligram um and it lets me go to sleep i don t take it any other nights because i have no need for it i sleep very fine it s only with the chemo drugs then so um you ve had biopsy but nothing no other surgery ? is that right ? well i had the um if that qualifies is a biopsy oh yeah and the day i had that it was downtown was this gray haired short man walking around didn t say anything to me and it was a young doctor who i d talked to on the phone and there were the nurses they were getting me ready my husband was there when they wheeled me in and i was starting to get groggy but not very groggy yet and the man that i d seen walking around came up to me and touched my shoulder and said i can t remember his name that well i m dr so and so and i m going to take very good care of you and it was the man who did the surgeon the other young doctor was like his helper or something maybe the resident yeah yeah but it was like whoa okay it s you know you try not mind with the young doctors but it s like i m all for age and experience yes when you re working on me i like age and experience is the number of false false negatives you can get they get in and they don t find it because they don t really get there and you know then you think there s no problem when actually it just they go to the right spot because it s very difficult he nailed both okay they never found a reason for that ? correct not that they told me not that i know of
i m just looking through the biopsy reports alright you had an ekg in march mm hmm and that s interesting yet it suggested that you may have had a little heart attack yeah hmm yeah you had a and still they this is nothing to do with any of that
right right and in fact now he s said that he won t even suggest removing it because it s more wrapped around is it tendons that are in there maybe ? um hmm and it would be far too difficult to remove considering it s just fatty tissue of no consequence how serendipitous how serendipitous yes okay well have we covered that whole story ? i think so yeah are there any questions you have for me ? nope i think i m doing okay alright um any other problems ? no i think nothing that s not related to um as you know i mean um my fatigue is directly related to the chemo and that s um my weight loss is planned mm hmm it s not you know it s not a result of what i m doing you re trying you were trying to lose some weight ? right i started in august with weight watchers so you re eating healthy ? lots of vegetables and fruits ? yes much healthy smaller smaller portions and smaller um and more frequent just because it s easier to tolerate that way and i think it keeps my energy level a little more even throughout the day mm hmm yes it does and eating protein all day long really good protein is a good thing you ve gone from to in a year and that s good that s good and actually i had gained more i was up to in august enjoying yourself too much yeah i was um back spasms ? that was something that you used to have problems with is that on the back burner now ? i guess it s yeah menopausal syndrome period stopped no menopausal symptoms ? mm mm okay alright everything s doing okay let s see family medical history heart attack in your father a stroke in your mother has anyone had any other medical problems in your family ? no no

good morning to you how are you ? i m fine thank you very much mm hmm okay so you re here for a physical ? yes i am mm hmm my yearly physical before we go to florida
okay and you wanted these prescriptions ? okay this here you can have a seat here so any problems ? any concerns today ? the best doctor you ll ever find
okay i m sorry ? do you have any problems ? uh you know i remember all this i wanted to ask you mm hmm you know i had uh my sister uh was just discovered with lung cancer now she s only mm hmm and uh she hasn t smoked in probably years okay ? and you know my concern is mm hmm i might need kind of an anti depressant maybe mild one just not to fill in case unless i needed it because of her situation mm hmm when was she diagnosed ? uh probably it s been about probably a month and a half ago okay and how you know and she started bad is it ? well it s bad it s a four and um it s not operable inoperable um but she s very upbeat but you d have to know my sister she s going on so she s very upbeat and she she knows what s up ahead and everything and and mm hmm mentally she s doing very well mm hmm um uh that s the kind of person she is mm hmm but anyway uh i ve never smoked but i ve been around second hand smoke because i do my karaoke dj service for years now my husband and i and unfortunately we ve been in some smoke you know environment mm hmm
um i had requested this is uh i had breast implants three years ago ? i want to say yeah three to four years ago mm hmm and i developed a a pretty steady cough that i had had for at that time when i mentioned it to my previous doctor um c lc mm hmm yeah and she didn t seem concerned she says well your lungs sound fine mm hmm you know listening to my chest and my back and everything and i was concerned but anyway mm hmm she showed no concern and i had mentioned a chest x ray at that time she said oh no you don t need a chest x ray your lungs are fine well you know ? mm hmm i think about it and my sister started coughing only for like five weeks four to five weeks mm hmm and decided to go have it checked out well that s when they discovered this lung cancer mm hmm not that you know i do understand that we all have a cancer cell and it just takes time to develop and whatever anyway so i thought when i come in i thought well maybe i m going to request a a chest x ray mm hmm uh but now i don t think i want one i mean i would like to mention that to you and i would like maybe you to if i can talk myself into having it now maybe i would like to have it mm hmm but after you know five weeks of her coughing and i had like a year of it maybe two years of it if that mm hmm probably a year of it when i talked to dr c mm hmm and you don t have any cough right now ? well i do periodically but what happened is they discovered that um i may just have a touch of asthma so they uh they i did see an allergist prior to you i believe and he gave me the prescription for the advair and it works wonderful i don t take it every day i don t have to but there are times if i wake up at two in the morning i have this cough and uh a little shortness of breath and i would take my advair and it would work perfect for me hmm so it works right away for you ? it works pretty quick for me um hmm how often do you use it ? well i don t have to use it very often i might use it there s times where use it uh once a day and it s generally in the morning if it s two in the morning or six in the morning depending if i make it through the night without the coughing i have no problem mm hmm so i don t want to say i probably use it um it depends if the allergy season is really bad for me and my allegra i m taking mm hmm i even my allegra i don t take every day mm hmm mm hmm i just need to have it when i need it so it s hard to say how often i take the advair like in the last uh couple of weeks how many times have you use it ? uh last couple of weeks probably maybe maybe once every three days and then that s only like i might take it today i took it this morning i might not need it again until maybe the end of the week next week mm hmm mm hmm do you get short of breath or mainly the cough ? it s uh a little shortness of breath i can feel it i can feel something in my chest like um probably a shortness of breath a little bit of cough not a lot of cough does that usually wake you up at night ? uh it was there for a while like at two in the morning three in the morning for some reason i d start coughing and it s a dry cough mm hmm and a little bit of phlegm you can feel a little bit of phlegm mm hmm um but i guess it s more of a shortness of breath so i take the advair and it would work pretty quick mm hmm okay and do you have the rescue inhaler ? albuterol ? no i don t have that just the advair no one ever gave that to you ? you know to use ? i m not sure honey i i uh don t think so because when i first had the um allergist mm hmm uh that s when he prescribed the advair okay did i had he prescribe you the nose spray along with the allegra ? hmm no he well flonase ? mm hmm okay i ve had i ve had the prescription for that i ve really not needed to take that mm hmm i used to take um uh what is that uh you can buy over the counter one ? um afrin ? afrin but that again was not on a regular basis that was only if i really felt i needed it mm hmm um so then they gave me the flonase because of course it s safer for you mm hmm but i because the afrin remember it s not more than two days in a row and something that you use on a repetitive basis right right because you can get used to it and your nose can start dripping once you stop using afrin and plus it s i believe it harms the membranes mm hmm which i can understand within you know using it over and over i would only use that if i were going to fly uh because i had a very bad experience with that once without realizing it but my allergies were so bad and my nose was so plugged i got on that plane i thought my head was going to explode and it was very scary and even after i got off the plane i couldn t hear for probably three hours you know where the blockage was so that taught me so i would use it if i had to fly and i had a problem if i didn t have a problem i didn t use it okay and if i was mm hmm so how often do you get to use that ? oh my gosh i haven t used afrin in a year or more maybe okay that s mm hmm and um your blood pressures are doing pretty good did you have any other surgery other than the breast implants in your lifetime ? uh no no ? okay no just you know a couple breast biopsies you know mm hmm um that were okay any other cancers in your family ? well my mother had uh died of breast uh well actually she had breast cancer she didn t die from it but she had breast cancer mm hmm so she died like years after that i guess right ? she had breast cancer in her s and she died mm hmm in her s of congestive heart failure ? yes of yes and she was diabetic as well lost both of her legs due to the diabetes when was the i m sorry ? go ahead my sister a had what they call pre cancer of the breast okay ? and that was probably geez i want to say five years ago and she had the radiation treatments for that and everything was fine okay and is that the same sister who has lung cancer now ? yes mm hmm mm hmm okay and how many brothers and sisters ? i have two sisters okay and your other sister is doing good ?
mm hmm and um so you re flying to where are you going ? we re going to um boca raton area uh we drive there oh you drive there ? we re retired we re both retired now so we drive there we stop in georgia spend the night with my son there and then we go on to florida and we do we we haven t had a winter here in uh six years seven years we stay there for the whole winter okay so you will be going there for the winter you will stay here for the summer ? rest of the summer and we come back the first of june uh mainly because our grandson s birthday and i have a son that s birthday is in june as well so i get to celebrate that and then we come home and then mm hmm hopefully by the mid june end of june we start getting nice weather here so so you will be going there like in we re going to be leaving like september th something like that okay so you won t be here for too much of fall huh ? yeah okay which fall is beautiful uh huh but the real part of the real reason we re leaving is we sold a home in plantation and now we re renting a condo and that condo is costing us dollars a day whether we re there or not so we decided we might as well you know eighty dollars a day huh ? eighty dollars a day so you ll be keeping that for well this will be our third year renting this condo so when we go down we re going to look for either something to buy or maybe something less expensive yeah this is a good time to buy we just we just sold we sold our home just before the bottom fell out and we sold it quicker than we thought so we were kind of without a place to house all of our furniture and everything so that s why we oh okay okay picked a condo that had some room so so that s why we go a little earlier now
okay so other than the cough and the allergies any other problems ? no well you know little uh mole removed from right here uh huh um last october um and it was a uh carcinoma uh not a carcinoma some kind of a cancer but not not the kind of cancer that was uh that s invasive or serious okay and so i had that scraped they scraped it and and i just had that checked so you re done with the whole procedure ? in june right ? so i m done with all of that okay okay and she looked at it in june said everything was good mm hmm do you use like a sunscreen when you you know i don t but i don t really my makeup has it but i don t really spend much time in the sun i m not a sun person mm hmm even though i know you should have it but i really don t mm hmm and the mole there did they say it was because of the sun or ? uh no i don t think it wasn t really the sun because of where it s at especially i m always covered uh but i think it was um you know when i was like in my young s years old i have a big mole on my back and i i went in to a dermatologist to have her look at it and she looked at a few others i m getting around in here mm hmm yeah yeah mm hmm and she says well that s just she said there s a long name for it she says seborrheic keratosis oh okay uh huh she said we ll give you the name she said they re fine she says but it s called barnacles of old age and i thought i m only ! so that s that s really what it was it s just sometimes it runs runs in families too it can yeah yeah and my mom my mom mm hmm i have some of these like this one yep yep yep mm hmm i have some little red ones and my mom had that too so they they i did have them looked at and everything was okay

you do have wax in your ears i do honey because i have trouble with hearing sometimes especially ear do you want them cleaned today ? does that hurt ? just put the ear drops and flush your ears because you have wax in both ears eah i know okay i ll do that
okay and um have you ever been on an anti depressant or something ? i have never through the years have you had a problem with depression or anxiety ? no i think not anything abnormal no and just with my sister going through this i don t know how good i can handle her going you know knowing mm hmm okay take a few deep breaths in and out good okay breathe normally okay do you feel anything draining in your chest ? into your throat ? uh yeah only if it s i m coughing and i can t get it to come up open your mouth again ah stick out your tongue ah yeah you do have the post nasal drip why don t you lay back ? i ll examine you and did you ever have any abnormal pap smears before ? anything wrong with your paps ?
no biopsies there nothing like that right ? okay put your arm up any sexually transmitted problems before in your lifetime ?
no okay are you happy with the breast reduction ? no ? i m not i shouldn t say that i to be honest with you i did it just for myself because as we have children and get older you know for um what all vanity whatever you want to call it uh so all i wanted was an implant to lift them up a little bit and so so you have the implants ? i have implants not a reduction okay right and so i my sister had the reduction mm hmm um but the funny thing is i picked the smallest one because i m not i you know i don t want any bigger than what i had and he the doctor was happy that i did that he says because of all his patients they always pick twice as big yeah uh huh but the funny part is i liked them when they were swollen after the swelling went down it looked like i didn t have anything done oh okay oh so and i m sorry i really had it because the thoughts of putting something inside your body it s not i m not i never wanted to do that it was just don t ask me i know what why i had to do it because i had to give him a dollar deposit that was non refundable and i m thinking you know what ? let s do it i wanted it done what kind of implants did you have put in ? just the saline uh yes but no i m sorry i did it because i i developed a terrible terrible infection from the uh stitches because for someone like you you would think so much before you have you re right you re right that s why i said i just and you never had any surgeries so for you to go that s right and have that done and i thought why did i do that ? uh huh that was but i did like it after it was done until the swelling went down then i thought eh why d i do it ? and you know i i like a lot of little t tops and stuff and when you ve got fatty boobs you know what i mean that s hanging in the wrong place you can t wear those tops
am i being recorded ? i forgot about that lord ! oh well at least you don t have a picture of my face
any back problems ? you know sometimes i do sometimes i do but i do try to lift with my legs like you re supposed to but i do manage to lift heavy things and i do get uh something back here that ll go down my left leg oh okay
how active are you ? i m not you re not i use the stairs a lot because we have a lot of stairs in our home up and down i uh but other than that uh do you do anything ? i don t really go out of my way to exercise or now if i m going shopping i will walk for two days and it doesn t bother me but if i have to walk around the block i m not interested because okay so there s no windows to shop from you don t put in any effort to do it no i don t if you have to you just go ahead and do it i will and i know i should my husband s after me all the time
mm hmm and how is your diet ? hmm when you say bad you don t ? do you snack a lot or ? i don t snack a lot i just know i don t eat healthy mm hmm you know i i will eat chicken meals chicken fish i don t want any fish i like tuna fish but i don t want any fish shrimp i ll eat deep fried and breaded which i know isn t good so no i m not really a healthy eater hmm okay i i i know i need to change that
mm hmm so the first thing let me talk to you about the cough okay ? with the lung cancer your cough could be one of the symptoms but especially in your case with the cough going on for so long and you having the cough on and off and on exam you do have some drainage in the back of your throat all of this goes along with post nasal drip allergies maybe some component of asthma which is making you short of breath so this cough will linger around on and off as long as you have this problem and the medications the advair mm hmm is something that you need to take every day rather than as needed hmm and why would that be ? it does not work that well if you take it as needed because it s not like a rescue inhaler which relieves the shortness of breath right away mm hmm so especially with your symptoms uh it s it s supposed to be taken every day one puff twice a day that way i think the shortness of breath the cough everything will be under much better control do you need that do you feel that you get short of breath when you walk around a lot exercise anything that brings it on during the day ? do you cut down on not really anything because of the shortness of breath ? not really not really ? uh uh okay and you use the advair how often you said ? i don t really use if i use it once every three days maybe just one puff i don t really even do two puffs because it and whatever the the problem is i m having it helps within five minutes yeah i don t think there s it could be because of the allergies and the drip that s making you short of breath mm hmm so if you control that you wouldn t have this problem on and off so i want you to um either go on the flonase or at least take the allegra every day it s one pill a day so take the allegra allegra i generally will take that now there for a while i wouldn t take it because i wasn t having a problem mm hmm and i i may not have a problem well it depends on the on the season i guess mm hmm the time of the allergies because yeah you can there s times i do take it every single day yeah try to keep track some people have trouble during the spring and the fall if that s the case start using it a couple of weeks before the weather changes hmm okay that way the symptoms will be under control because this tends to be a chronic problem okay because it ll keep bothering you on and off and you should know how to control it and these medications are usually something that you take on a regular basis okay i guess i just didn t want to get used to something and then maybe have it not work for me anymore and maybe that s why i was oh there s nothing like that and with these conditions we mainly focus on controlling the symptoms really good so that you don t have any symptoms controlling the underlying conditions rather than take it when you have symptoms mm hmm okay ? so my suggestion would be at least take the allegra every day and you will notice that you won t be getting that short of breath that often you know i think you re right because i do when i do have to take it every day and i know it s helping me but i don t seem to have that problem mm hmm because some seasons it might be completely fine but it all uh is you have to try it out and see mm hmm with the allegra when you need it try taking it every day every day okay because the advair the way you re taking it it it doesn t do much really not doing much okay because it so you might as well not take it it s because once every three days is mainly i feel you have you feel good just taking it thinking that you re taking something but it doesn t do much once every three days okay ? so if you don t need it you don t need it but at least take the allegra every day so that you don t get short of breath that would be my suggestion and the cough i think it s mainly from the drainage mm hmm i don t think you need a chest x ray at this point okay ?
as far as lung cancer unfortunately that can happen even to non smokers oh i know and that s why i say okay ? with my entertainment mm hmm music we re in smoke rooms all the i don t smoke and i know that s just as bad for you second hand smoking and the and i try to avoid i don t do it as much now because we ve we lose jobs here in michigan when we go back to florida and i and it s hard to gain news jobs oh okay because they re already there so it s not like i m doing it on a regular like i was doing it twice a week uh probably for two years in the beginning mm hmm and then you know i kind of cut down but uh as far as lung cancer unfortunately we don t have a screening test either taking a chest x ray well see that s how they found her cancer was she went because it was so so advanced it s not for screening she already had the symptoms mm hmm because it s to a point where it s showing up on the chest x ray we have uh lost the chance to treat mm hmm that s how lung cancer is unfortunately when it presents it presents full blown and uh as far as chest x ray in your case you have the chest x ray now if it s fine it doesn t mean much okay ? because it s not a good screening tool and there s no reason for you to have the chest x ray your lungs are completely clear your symptoms are very typical for allergies and i know you re concerned because your sister has it but at the same time the best thing that you can do for yourself is eat healthy
i know the antioxidants might help so try eating healthy exercise regularly the number one killer is heart disease although we think about cancer so much right yeah it s the heart disease that s the number one killer so work on a healthy lifestyle mm hmm that will make you feel better that will elevate your mood too just getting some exercise mm hmm
going out of your way just doing something because it s good for you i know
that itself is lifts your mood up and as far as the anti depressant um uh you know are you having any problem where like trouble sleeping or with your appetite ? that s mainly mainly it s the sleeping mm hmm like i don t i m i go to bed um you know and it doesn t take me too long to go to sleep mm hmm but i wake up you know maybe three hours into it and then i m up for two hours and i go back to sleep and a lot of it is when things are on your mind yep yep mm hmm and you know with with my boys too y ou know they re struggling out there like everybody else trying to keep their job and mm hmm mm hmm family and then my sister with her situation it s like i the mind is just you know yeah it doesn t want to shut off it s it yeah and it s it s depressing it keeps going and during the daytime have you noticed that you re more irritable kind of snappy or only on occasion with that because generally i m a very happy person and my sister being as upbeat as she is of course will keep me upbeat with her mm hmm okay it s just at night it seems like at night when i finally fall asleep i don t go to bed so much thinking about all of this it just wakes me up in the middle of the night thinking about it mm hmm how long have you had this problem sleeping for ? um oh did you always have a problem sleeping kind of or it s oh i m sorry i thought i had that turned off sorry no i haven t um it s been more so with her situation mm hmm okay you know worrying about her because at this time it s not like you re going through depression okay ? medical depression is where it interferes with your day to day stuff you re withdrawn you don t socialize you re snappy and stuff like that you don t have all that it s mainly because of the stress and just adjustment just the situation i guess to the situation what you re going through right now and uh maybe i can give you a few sleeping pills to take for the time being that would help um you know what ? maybe what i can do too honey is what it is is as she she doesn t start her first treatment until monday and i think if i notice a big difference down difference with her then i don t know it won t be so easy to handle mm hmm so maybe i ll call mm hmm sure yep yep mm hmm i know i know it s hard because uh it s it s hard for some people especially if you have a tendency towards depression you can have a very hard time dealing with stuff like this right and i think that s the hardest no matter what it will take time but uh sometimes you completely shut off and uh if that happens you can t function you re like leave me alone and and stuff but right now i think you know i don t really want to take anything that i don t need right now but in case in case in case yeah if symptoms that that s not a bad idea because right now you re not depressed but depending on how things go if you need something uh huh shall i give you a prescription ? uh or you want to talk to me then if something like that happens ? maybe if i got a prescription like i said if i have it because we re going to be in florida for so long i could probably get one from you pretty quick anyway if i called you from florida so maybe we ll just wait on that then yeah and i would like to talk to you at that time see what s going on that way i will have a right just in case idea into what s going on and what you started and what to look for okay ? yeah we ll do that yeah you can always call my nurse will take the call but i ll call you back when i m in between patients and talk to you okay let s do that then okay ? because i just and you know maybe it will work out and i won t need it but just in case you know i if i need it it s there yeah talk to people yeah yeah your family support and yeah yeah we do we yeah spiritual and stuff like that yeah it s just like i said it s really you have to she s really good mentally and that really helps all of us but you know oh no those these are dark times it s it s never easy with something like this yeah right right oh does she have children ? oh she has one grown son one grown son okay okay so of course he s grown if she s right ? she has one son
and um the pap smear you don t have to worry about that this year we can do it every two years oh every two years ? okay every two or three years because you re low risk okay good your age and and no previous problems in the past you are low risk so okay alright but the colonoscopy is something that i would think about but at least i will give you the stool cards for now at least do that okay okay ?
and uh your blood pressure is doing good let me go ahead and order for an ekg okay ? and we ll wash your ears and um these are your prescriptions and uh and the mammogram i m supposed to go in september i do have an appointment for that i ll give you an order for that yeah i ll give you an order and then the blood work that i always have i ll take care of everything okay good and uh especially the sugar yeah yeah and uh did you have a tetanus booster in the last ten years ? i you know i want to say i have yeah you had it okay ! alright well thank you so much have a nice trip and i hope your sister does good thank you very much appreciate it and uh let me know okay ? call me and let me know i will if you need my help i will okay ? i thank you very much honey take care now thank you mm hmm i ll just be waiting outside okay honey thank you

yeah ah ah when i came in here last month about my mm hmm and that decongestant i had it uh huh now the sinus mm hmm the last down in there and at times i have a little it s not a pain but a little hurting right up in here around the chest area mm hmm and my suggestion i want is to have a chest x ray done and i also want x rays done on my um on my throat here for my ah thyroid okay um do you have a history of thyroid problems ? not that i know of but my sister told me that she had it and uh and made me wanna look into it okay what was the nature of your sister s thyroid problems ? uh she had said it she only thing she explained to me was that uh looked a lot heavier some people can get fatter or smaller but the thyroid is underactive ? cause we don t x ray the thyroid we check the blood tests blood tests oh okay that s how we check the thyroid and it s not necessarily anything that runs in the family oh right okay are you currently taking any medications ? have prescribed for me okay let me see if i have em my ah potassium ran out cause she told me to double up on that okay now have you had any hospitalizations or operations ? none and are your parents still alive ? my except my father ah your mother is deceased ? or your father is deceased ? my father how old was he when he died ? and what caused his death ? uh i m pretty sure they say a heart attack and then how old is your mother ? she ll be coming up in april does she have any medical problems ? she have uh uh far as i know a heart attack cholesterol mm hmm and high blood do you have any brothers ? i have yeah how many ? i have let s see one two three four living and how many deceased ? any sisters ? i have two sisters any deceased ? do you smoke drink or use drugs ? and how old were you when you first started your menstrual periods ? maybe around ten or and the last period was when ? i guess coulda i shoulda been somewhere about something in there and then um have you ever been pregnant ? i have three kids yeah uh okay just three pregnancies ? or more ? i had no i had one stillborn mm hmm and i also had ah abortion ? okay so you had five pregnancies ? but you delivered three four babies ? one was a stillborn ? and one abortion ? uh huh okay now medications are you still on the water pill ? hydrochlorothiazide ? uh huh and the uh potassium um now let s see you take two potassium a day ? that s what last start me on yeah and then are you do you go to cvs on michigan ? yes i do okay and are you still on the norvasc ? for blood pressure ? yes and no i uh the intern told me to double up on them also so i m taking instead of i m taking that s the hydrochlorothiazide that s for the blood pressure yeah hydrochlorothiazide norvasc is milligrams oh that s uh for well that s probably for the sinus stuff right ? uh huh norvasc is for blood pressure i never i the blue pills what s the name of em ? oh let me see do i have em ? i thought i have you on two different pills for blood pressure oh that yeah that s the little tiny white one then ? and then one and then norvasc you have a water pill and norvasc okay so then there times where that must be what making drowsy making me fy then cause i know there s something that i ve i ve started taking and i ve lately and i gets kinda sleepy behind okay but do you have a medicine that s a ten milligram pill ? one should be that s the water pill then you should have norvasc ten milligrams that s the blood pressure pill i m taking i m i thought these was blood pressure pill too well one is a water pill this here is the water pill here okay and then and then the norvasc how long you been on the norvasc ? well i don t the other one ? cause i think because it s the one i got now the last prescription you gave me wasn t norvasc that probably was was it for sinus ? loratadine okay right and i don t have any you don t have norvasc ? okay i ll send it to your pharmacy cause you re supposed to be on that one for blood pressure along with the water pill so you should have norvasc you should have the water pill the last time we saw you we gave you a antibiotic and uh we also increased the water pill from to but you should also be on norvasc for blood pressure yeah and i just sent it to your pharmacy
alright ? now your mammogram is gonna be due in march so do you have the slip already ? okay and have you had that test where they take the lighted tube and look in your rectum ? to check for colon of course the only time i did that get ready for that they always tells me my blood is low mm hmm okay now the mammogram is low whatever you know you get once a year over the colon test the last indication that we tried to do it two years ago they said they couldn t let me see what she say
saying that my potassium s still low and i wanna know why cause something have to be draining it cause i m i m doing pretty much more than i should far as ah with potassium okay and i sent a new prescription to your pharmacy so that you know you ll get enough to take two potassium tablets a day so cause you said you had doubled up on em right ? okay now has your app is your appetite been good and weight stable ? my appetite is okay and i don t want it to be too good any ringing in your ears or dizziness ? i don t i don t have no ringing in my ear but sometimes feel like they want to clog okay any uh shortness of breath chest pain cough ? which one ? okay when do you get the shortness of breath ? mostly when i m trying to go up stairs and what about uh chest pain ? uh and they they comes and then they go okay when do you usually get em ? well they started behind this cough uh huh and and are you bringing up anything with the cough ? well i m not bringing up anything with the cough have a seat up here uh huh but i notice with at that time i can bring some of it up it s all not cleared out okay have you been taking cough syrup ? until i can t get no more i beg your pardon ? i take it i took i had until i can get some more okay what cough syrup did you take ? uh that form uh uh d ? uh uh what is it that you told me to get ? um oh what it is i can t even think of that name uh oh it ll come to me but i i i takes that and i think my blood pressure goes up too yeah but you not taking all the medicine you supposed to be taking cause the norvasc you re supposed to be on the one we just talked about i don t think you re taking it and you re supposed to be on norvasc plus the water pill well i got the water pill yeah turn your head that way that s what i m saying that s why i said i called that the other pill the norvasc to the pharmacy for you so that s why your blood pressure s high you are actually only taking one pill which is the water pill you re supposed to be on the other one too so i sent it to your pharmacy so you can pick it up and uh start taking it as soon as you can and that should bring your blood pressure down huh wasn t that normal ? um i walked a lot mm hmm and my feet usually swell at night the swelling is not as bad as it used to be mm hmm so i think that s a good deal
